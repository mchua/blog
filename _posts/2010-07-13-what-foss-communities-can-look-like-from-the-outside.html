<p>I found this <a href="http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/iaep/2010-July/011362.html">mailing list conversation snippet</a> to be very insightful, and wanted to share it.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Scott:</b> "Open to critique" isn't quite the same as "responsive to critique". From an outside perspective, it seems that frequently SugarLabs is just not listening to people who offer contrary opinions.&nbsp; This is better than flaming them,   but maybe not as good as it could be. For an end-of-year report, I'd like to see instances enumerated where SugarLabs actually internalized some outside critique and responded in a positive way -- some concrete change made to the UI, or Sugar, or to process.&nbsp; That would be more convincing that simply stating, "we are now open to critique".<br />&nbsp;<br /><b>Bernie:</b> We're definitely intimidating to non-technical people. At least, this is what I sensed at the Realness Summit. OLE also seems to be doing a better job at connecting with educators. I'm not completely sure what corrective actions should be. We might need to do some work on the&nbsp; wiki, maybe add web forums, which non-geeks tend to prefer...</p>
<p><b>Scott:</b> I suspect that the answer to this problem does not involve installing additional software.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later in the day, Jeff and I were having this conversation on #teachingopensource.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Jeff:</b> Is IRC really a barrier to entry?&nbsp; maybe I have simply been using it too long, but it seems immediately recognizable to me. I think one barrier might be the attitudes that crop up.&nbsp; Even with emoticons, sometimes it's hard to discern intent.&nbsp; Hard enough in email, but sometimes devastating in real time.</p>
<p><b>Mel:</b> Actually, yes. I had a really, really hard time figuring out IRC. First, figuring out that it existed and I had to use it. Then how to get it, how to set the software up. Then what the heck networks and channels and whatnot were - and why channels? my IM paradigm was "you have a buddy list and you ping people individually." So "chatrooms are the default!" wasn't hard to understand once I realized it, but it took a while to realize because I wasn't looking for it.</p>
<p>And then "oh man, who are all these people? I am nervous about pinging them, will they yell at me?" And then all the /commands I had to remember. It was so bewildering and terrifying and new <i>and</i> it was being used as a way to present new information to me at the same time, sort of like... taking your first calculus class in... Mandarin, if you've also just started studying Mandarin as a foreign language. You can't concentrate much on the calculus because you're going "zomg it's in CHINESE."</p></blockquote>
<p>It's hard to remember how <i>hard</i> things can be, especially when you're surrounded by a community of people who are the ones who <i>self-selected</i> and <i>made</i> it past that hardness. By definition, if you've gotten into FOSS, the current participation mechanisms worked for you... so why fix them?</p>
<p>Because we want others to join us.</p>
