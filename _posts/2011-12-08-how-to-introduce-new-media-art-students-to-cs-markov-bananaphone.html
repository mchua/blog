<p><a href="http://marabattiste.com/">Mara Battiste</a>,   one of my classmates in <a href="http://www.gardensandmachines.com/AD61600/">Form Follows Data</a> (from the <a href="http://www.cla.purdue.edu/vpa/etb/">Electronic and Time-Based Art</a> department), is a practicing artist and art teacher. She came into class the other day with an analysis of Beyonce's songs - turns out they break down nicely into four categories that go something like this:
<ul>
<li>That man done me wrong and I ain't pleased (example: Resentment)</li>
<li>I'm really hot and awesome and don't need that guy (example: Single Ladies)</li>
<li>So totally in love (example: Crazy In Love)</li>
<li>Let me just sing about sex (example: Fever)</li>
</ul>
<p>So she'd been trying to do audio manipulation and make some generic Beyonce mashups - what's the overarching "That man done me wrong and I ain't pleased" Beyonce song? - but the musical styles for the similarly-themed songs were all over the place and it sounded horrid.</p>
<p>"Why not try it with just the lyrics?" I suggested. "You could run all the songs for a given class through a Markov generator..."</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>I'll let <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Markov_text_generators">Wikipedia explain it</a>, but the quick demo I whipped up with an <a href="http://www.beetleinabox.com/markov.html">online generator</a> was sufficient to crack up the class. And I dunno, but maybe I'll get requests to help with some generator code later on... but in any case, behold: excerpts from Beyonce's "Single Ladies" mashed up with Raffi's "Bananaphone."</p>
<blockquote><p>All the single ladies)<br /> All the single ladies (all the one you shoulda put a ring ring<br /> Banana phone, ring ring on it<br /> If you like it then you shoulda put a call around the single ladies (all the best! Beats the single ladies)</p>
<p>All the single ladies (all the single ladies (all the one you like it<br />
then you shoulda put your phone with a ring ring ring on my cup (cup)<br /> I got this feeling, so appealing,<br /> for pizza. I'll call the single ladies (all the white house, have a ring ring ring on it<br /> If you had your phone with a ring ring ring on it<br /> If you see that thing!<br /> (Piano Solo)</p>
<p>Cause another brother noticed me<br /> Cause another brother and papa phone,<br /> a ring banana phone</p>
<p>If you like it then you shoulda put a ring ring on it<br /> Wha-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br /> Cause if you think<br /> I deserve<br /> Here's a friend of the single ladies (all the rest!<br /> Cellular, modular, interactivodular!<br /> Ring ring ring ring on my hips (hips)<br /> Hold me Beijing-jing-jing-jing!<br /> (Soprano Sax Solo)<br /> Yeah!</p>
