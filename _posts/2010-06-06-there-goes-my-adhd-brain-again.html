<p>Occasionally, one of my (usually older) friends will post something that exemplifies the way I'd like to grow up into thinking about a topic. In this case, <a href="http://sachachua.com/wp/2010/06/personal-finance/">Sacha on personal finances</a>. I'm pretty happy with how I'm doing with the learning on that front, really - but it's nice to look ahead and see what that thinking may look like a few years from now when I'm her age. On the complete opposite end of the spectrum (but just as wonderful) is <a href="http://facelessmignon.blogspot.com/2010/06/geotown-caches-pt1.html">Suzanne</a> in the moments when she's writing her prose with a poetic flair. And someday I hope to be able to write textbooks like Sanjoy - in this case, <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/full_pdfs/Street-Fighting_Mathematics.pdf">Street-Fighting Mathematics</a>.</p>
<p>I point out these examples of writing because I can't write well right at this moment; my brain's too full and buzzy. Scattered. Not <i>bad</i>, but it should be clearer, calmer, more focused... I am trying to do too many things at once. You can see it and hear it in the way I write and the way I talk and the jerkiness of my movements as I scutter between tasks in my room. I need a conversation thread to focus on; I need a way to step back and prioritize. So that's what I'm forcing myself through now - writing the script that will get me through tomorrow's early morning.</p>
<ol>
<li>Regain consciousness! Possibly stretch a bit, check to make sure there aren't urgent messages waiting for me online.</li>
<li>Start burning POSSE Remix CDs and finding thumbdrives for folks to burn SoaS onto.</li>
<li>Update the schedule on the POSSE Worcester wiki page, and post the attendees list there.</li>
<li>Inbox-zero your personal email.</li>
<li>At this point, the sun should be up. Go running!</li>
<li>Come back and take a shower and eat breakfast.</li>
<li>Send POSSE RIT all the stuff they need.</li>
<li>Poke POSSE California.</li>
<li>Finish your prep for the SoaS meeting this afternoon.</li>
<li>At this point, it should be close to 6:45am. At 6:45am, you should be headed to your car to pick up Walter.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yeah, tomorrow is going to be an early start. I'm going to bed now.</p>
