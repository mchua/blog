<p>As <a href="http://blog.sdziallas.com/greetings-from-florida-educomm-day-0">Sebastian announced last night</a>, we've just finished our talk on <a href="http://www.educommconference.com/content/open-source-textbooks-collaboration-workflows">Open Source Textbooks and Collaboration Workflows</a> at <a href="http://www.educommconference.com">EduComm</a>. The full talk notes and slides, along with installation and usage instructions, are available on the <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/EduComm#Learn_more">talk's website</a> under a creative commons license, in the name of practicing what we preach. It was a great crowd, with lively questions (do practices like live note-taking disrupt a classroom? are there any communication tools that aren't primarily text-based?) and some good suggestions and feedback afterwards. Thanks to everyone who attended!</p>
<p>Several questions came up that led to <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/EduComm#Learn_more">more resources</a> that weren't in the original talk. In particular, some attendees were interested in what next steps they could take to go further, so we referred them to the <a class="external free" rel="nofollow" href="http://communityleadershipteam.org/posse">Professors' Open Source Summer Experience</a> workshop that we run for faculty who are interested in integrating the open source way into their teaching.</p>
<p>We've got a little followup to do with individuals, but tonight's remaining agenda is to go to Disneyworld. My quest for tomorrow: I will somehow obtain the picture of Sebastian in a Mickey Mouse hat and myself in pirate gear that was taken almost immediately afterwards. Somehow.</p>
