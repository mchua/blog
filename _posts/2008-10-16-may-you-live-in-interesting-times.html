<p>Boston-area geeks: Y'all should come to <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1234353">Information Superhighway One</a>. It's going to rock. Totally rock. Hard.</p>
<p>Also,   it's... not a good idea to eat homemade gelato when you've just come in from being cold outside. I don't know why I did this. Oh, wait. "AIEE! IT WILL GO BAD! PUT IT IN BLENDER!" .....yeah, that's what happened. Um. Warm fuzzy sweater, where are you?</p>
<p>There is a fortune cookie fortune taped to my door. I actually got it inside a fortune cookie. </p>

<p>Sometimes it's tough, but I do like to think of this one as a blessing.</p>
