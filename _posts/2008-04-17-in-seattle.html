<p>Hurrah, I'm in Seattle! Now with luggage - it got delayed and they only delivered it yesterday (the day after I'd arrived) so I have plenty of catching-up to do on "work." There's something surreal about dodging taxis in NYC one day,   sleeping on a friend's couch in Boston the next, and running through tulip fields on the other side of the country on the third.</p>
<p>All my cousins have suddenly gotten big. I'm not sure when this happened, but I should be used to it by now. I should also go see them more often so I don't have "wait... you're speaking in multi-clause sentences? This happened when?" moments quite as much.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a pretty boring post. I could fill it in with all the grandmother birthday celebration stuff that happened yesterday, but I think I'll remember it, so that's good enough for me. I will, however, note that one of the decorations my younger cousins put up made all the older ones mildly disturbed - they suspended a stuffed toy dog (one of the Target stuffed animals) from the balcony by means of a yarn noose around its neck so that it hung with its mouth slightly open, swaying back and forth in the living room. We quickly cut it down.</p>
<p>I wonder how often I'll get to see the sun in this state while I'm here for the next 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Oh, also - if you're in the WA area, <a href="http://linuxfestnorthwest.org">linuxfestnorthwest.org</a> - come on over. I'll be presenting.</p>
