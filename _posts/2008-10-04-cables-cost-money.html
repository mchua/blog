<p>Cables for electronic instruments cost a lot of money. They are pieces of <i>wire</i>. Encapsulated by rubber. With plugs at the end. How does 6 feet of this stuff end up costing $18? At least I will be able to record tracks now. Reminder to self: I am not allowed to get a guitar and <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2006/04/28/project-idea-electric-acoustic-travel-guitar/">mod it</a> until I can play the piano properly in public.</p>
<p>One of the best features of my digital piano is its headphone output. This lets me play completely without shame - it's amazing how fast my hands lock up the moment I turn on external speakers. I am beginning to play on random pianos (starting with pika's when I go there for bread-baking lessons tomorrow) to attempt to get over this hump; right now I start out timidly, forget I'm scared at some point midway through the song, and <i>then</i> I can let loose with blues licks, walking bass lines, whatever.</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:DyD">Ian Daniher</a> is here, visiting OLPC and then Olin, in that order. He's in the office with Seth doing crazy things with arduinos.</p>
<p>I realized I haven't been keeping people very up-to-date on what I've been doing because I've been too busy doing too much <i>stuff</i>. I'm trying to change this. I want to have a more openly documented life; it's been a good experiment so far, but I am slacking.</p>
<p>Right now: pasta and listening to Greg and Ellen try to game a voting system. I'll start describing yet more projects next.</p>
