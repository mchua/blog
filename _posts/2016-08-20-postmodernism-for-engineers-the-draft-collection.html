<div data-offset-key="c2hrq-0-0">I'm having some pretty big affective-intellectual anxiety right now around (re)writing the theoretical chapter of my dissertation, which tries to explain postmodernism to an engineering audience. Which is a big scary translation, in my eyes -- I feel like I'm a postmodernism novice who's blindly babbling about this (not true, but... impostor syndrome!)</div>

<div data-offset-key="8l276-0-0">So I split it into short essays targeted at specific topics. It was supposed to be around 10 pages; it's actually around 25. (Oops. Turns out I know more about this than I thought.) If you're (1) a technical-ish person interested in seeing whether my explanations of postmodern concepts work for you, or (2) someone familiar with what postmodernism is (at a really basic level) and would tell me if you think I'm translating the ideas accurately, I would LOVE writing feedback.</div>

Edits will be made to this version, so don't be surprised if it is slightly different (and hopefully better) than the blog post sectionings listed below.

<li><a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2016/08/18/postmodernism-what-is-it-for-engineers/">What's postmodernism</a> (and how do I explain it to engineers)?</li>
<li>Okay, fine, you can't define postmodernism, <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2016/08/19/postmodernism-a-reluctant-historical-progression/">so I'll provide a history of how it came to be.</a> (Followed immediately by section 2.5, or: by the way, a postmodernist reading of the historical I just provided basically demands that I go <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2016/08/19/postmodernism-a-troubling-of-the-historical-narrative-i-just-provided-for-postmodernism/">"but that narrative isn't a single clear explanation either!"</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2016/08/20/postmodernism-paradigmatic-comparison/">Comparison with other (probably more familiar) paradigms</a>, including positivism aka "this is probably what you think science is."</li>
<li>Parts 4-6 present some key ideas in postmodern thought, and how they relate to ideas familiar to engineers. The first one is <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2016/08/17/postmodernism-power-and-agency-readerlywriterly/">power and agency</a> (otherwise known as commit access)</li>
<li>Then there's <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2016/08/17/postmodernism-many-truths-and-meanings-intersubjective-intertext-signs-signifiers-slippage/">truth and meaning...</a> (otherwise known as design reviews)</li>
<li>...and finally <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2016/08/18/postmodernism-slicing-and-separations-agential-and-other-cuts/">slicing and separations</a> (otherwise known as black-boxing)</li>
<li>Bringing it home: <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2016/08/19/postmodernism-in-engineering-education-praxis/">postmodernism as a language to describe aspects of engineering practice</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2016/08/19/postmodernism-what-engineering-education-might-learn-from-the-postmodern-turn-in-educational-studies/">Finally, looking at educational studies</a> as a place where the "postmodern turn" has already happened, and what engineering might learn from that.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ignore my (horrible and inconsistent) citation practices. And yes, there are obvious "I wanted to keep writing so I stuck NOTES IN ALL CAPS HERE and moved on" markers. Look, I'm just... trying to... get this out, ok? It's taken me... a couple years, and I finally wrote all this in about 2 days.</p>
