<p>One of my uncles sent me <a href="http://www.globecampus.ca/blogs/nerd-girl/">this blog post</a>. According to the okcupid test, I am a "pure nerd" (85% nerd, in any case; in the mid-thirties for Geek and Dork.) "A Nerd is someone who is passionate about learning/being smart/academia." Sounds about right.</p>
<p>Happiness is two artichokes dripping with melted butter, fresh cranberries blended with orange juice, and chardonnay cauliflower soup sweetened with carrots and spiked with garam masala. This was the lunch I cooked today, and it took 20 minutes (ok, 21 if you count melting the butter in the microwave). I would like to learn to blend my own garam masala - it would be gorgeous, when I have a bigger kitchen, to have a mortar and pestle, and whole spices, and fresh herbs. I love the aromatic oils of basil and mint leaves when you crush them (separately - actually, I have no idea how they go together; I don't <em>think</em> they do.)</p>
<p>I've been jittery as of late, but able to calm myself down into focus - it is good to be more aware and in control of this now, instead of letting {hyper, hypo}focus just happen and surprise me later when I realize I've wasted N minutes (hours, days). I started doing a million things at once after lunch, and went past my "happily busy" point, and my mind started to splinter too much - but I caught it, and I sent myself to take a shower, and then I went to wash the dishes, and said "Mel, when you wash the dishes, <em>wash the dishes</em>," and so I... washed the dishes. <em>Just</em> washed the dishes. Hot water, soap, a brush, a bowl.</p>
<p>Then I could do stuff.</p>
<p>I think that's why I like small, powerful toolsets. They're eigenvectors. I can keep them in my brain without getting all antsy from the clutter that results from when I feel like I have to keep looking for <em>more; </em>I know they span the basis, so I can relax and solve the problem.</p>
<p>Tomorrow before leaving for work, I need to do the following (far overdue):</p>
<ul>
<li>buy groceries (we have no cumin, eggs, or juice of any sort, are low on frozen veggies, and have neither soy nor coconut milk, etc.)</li>
<li>deep-clean Yavin IV before our first guest for Sugarcamp arrives (hurrah, Dave Farning!)</li>
<li>purvey a new comforter (my old one is past its useful life, and it is getting cold at night.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Forced rest is <em>exhausting</em>. It's more work to rest than it is to work - but it does let me refill (and therefore enable me to empty out) my various reservoirs, so I am going to continue. Preparing and enjoying good food (preferably with friends) also helps. Music helps. Walking helps. Running, I think, helps. (I have long legs! It's like running with wings! I just can't do it for very long. Yet.) Kicking things also helps.</p>
<p>Oh yes - <a href="http://www.wickedlocal.com/cambridge/news/x541346098/Fight-club-Boxers-kick-and-spar-in-underground-gym">kicking things</a>! (Yep, I'm somewhere in there.)</p>
<p>Also, a friend of mine might go into audiology. They have been forewarned that if this happens, they shall be peppered with constant questions about <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, I am almost happy with this poem. Happy enough to let it go and call it done at last.<em> Edit: Poem now actually displays. Bloody HTML.<br />
</em></p>
<pre>Orpheus
-------------
A needled snake, red sirens keening.
There she went. You found her,
and you let her gently down.

Drinking cheap sorrow
in the weeks that followed, you learned
that only grief-stricken songs still held your gaze.

Once before, you would obey their sound;
now your heart is as a bruised white flower,
folded within itself. Had she returned,
you would still wear her waking shroud.
