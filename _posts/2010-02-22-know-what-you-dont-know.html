<p>Via Karlie: <a href="http://jangosteve.com/post/380926251/no-one-knows-what-theyre-doing">No one knows what they're doing.</a> (Warning: light profanity. Also wryly hilarious.)</p>
<p>When we were interviewing students for co-op positions on Tuesday morning, Remy put them through a skills inventory, asking them to rate themselves from 1-10 on things like "Python ability" or "sysadmin skills." I found this fascinating, because it told us not how good they were, nor how good they thought they were, but how good they were going to <i>tell us</i> they thought they were. In some ways, it's a cockiness filter; you watch for how they back up their answers with other things they say and do in their interview. In some ways, it's a gauge of how much you know-you-don't-know - how conscious are you of what you need to learn?</p>
<p>When I thought of how I'd answer these questions myself, I figured that the full answer would come in three parts.
<ol>
<li>Here's what I know exists in the domain you just described. (For instance, "ASL ability implies handshapes, spatial grammar, regional variants, vocabulary, idioms....")</li>
<li>Of that set, here is what I <i>do </i>know and what I don't, and in what context. ("I can fingerpell, I only know a few idioms, I've mostly signed with a small group of people in my high school from a book so I know there are regional variants and idioms but don't know what they are...")</li>
<li>Here is how confident I am that the set I described in #1 actually describes the domain - how much I think I don't-know-I-don't-know. ("There may be other things I don't know about yet, but I think this should mostly span the space.")</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, that's long. And complicated. And you want a 1-10 number <i>right now</i>. So I would clarify my scale ("0 is 'never heard of it,' 5 is 'fuzzy, but at the point where I can learn by doing,' 10 is 'would be comfortable teaching you this right now,' based on the amount of skill I think we'd need to do the project that you just described) and then give the quick numbers runoff.</p>
<p>But I also prefer letting people just show me what they can do. Instead of asking "how well do you learn new programming languages," I plonk down code in a language they're unfamiliar with and tell them to look at it, think out loud, and ask questions about how it works. Tell me a story about how you taught yourself something you were interested in - and not for any school assignment. Link me to your blog or the archives of a forum or a mailing list you're active on so I can see how you talk with other people in normal online conversation.</p>
<p>There are no perfect ways of measuring. I'm still thinking through this - the quality of writing in this post reflects the scatteredness of my thoughts - but it's a set of ideas that I'm thinkering with (I love that portmanteau) because I think there are better ways to catch better people for <i>precisely</i> what you need, and better ways to figure out what you are looking for, and to express that.</p>
<p>Figuring this out will mean I get to go through some old memories and notes of really painful interviews (of me - I have flamed out in interviews before, and I have also nailed them). What worked, what didn't work, what do I think they measured, what do I think they missed? (Sometimes interviews go badly because they <i>should</i> - because it's not a fit. Other times, the measurement tool is in error.) I'll also be comparing notes with other people. Stories welcome.</p>
