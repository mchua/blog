<p>Just for fun, here's how the logo for <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_2009">POSSE</a> was created, with many thanks to Mo for the design help!</p>
<p>I took Mo's sketch...</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="http://blog.melchua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/posse-logo-sketch.png" /></p>
<p>...and had some fun in Inkscape. Note that my color-pickin' skills are more or less on par with a blind dog's.</p>

<p>And then Mo went *apply-design-skillz!* and I went *zomgawesometweak!* and a bit of tinkering later we have...</p>

<p>...okay, the stuff that's getting printed isn't going to have the "w00t," because I think most people are slightly more conservative than I am with regards to what they'd like on cards they're handing out to university administrators. Variants are available at <a href="http://mchua.fedorapeople.org/posse">http://mchua.fedorapeople.org/posse</a>, including a just-the-owl version and 2 and 3 color gradientless versions for screenprinting.</p>
<p>Next up: a more serious and comprehensive update on the state of POSSE, which is coming up in just a week.</p>
