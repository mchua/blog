<p>People keep asking how my dissertation is going.</p>
<p>I hate crawling through the thousands of constant momentary choices to stick into my dissertation research, make it better, make it <em>better</em>, not trying to plaster it over with pretty things, but generating <em>stuff </em>and figuring out what stuff is crap and what isn't.</p>
<p>I hate it, but I also love it, because it's the person I want to be. Someone who can stick through hard to do something that's good. And I want to be held to that standard, to be expected to produce good work, to be expected to make arguments for why my work is good. It's a sign of respect (excerpt from "<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/my-writing-education-a-timeline">My Writing Education: A Time Line</a>," by George Saunders, via <a href="http://ablersite.org/about/">Sara Hendren</a>).</p>
<blockquote><p>I have my final thesis meeting with Doug. My thesis...is crap.... I know I haven’t done good work, but don’t want to hear that. But I also don’t want to hear that what I know is bad, is good....</p>
<p>What Doug does at this meeting is increase my self-esteem by confirming that my perception of the work I’d been doing is fundamentally accurate. The work I’ve been doing is bad. Or, worse: it’s blah. This is uplifting–liberating, even—to have my unspoken opinion of my work confirmed. I don’t have to pretend bad is good. This frees me to leave it behind and move on and try to do something better. The main thing I feel: respected. Doug conveys a sense that I am a good-enough writer and person to take this not-great news in stride and move on. One bad set of pages isn’t the end of the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>My greatest temptation is to throw old things away and start from scratch constantly, thinking that my old stuff isn't good enough, that surely I can make something glorious and gleaming if I only reboot. But there is good in my old piles of crap, and there is good in my data and my analysis; I have to keep looking at what is, not where I'd like things to be. It's the only way I'll make the things that are into the things I want them to become.</p>
