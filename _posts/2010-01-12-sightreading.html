<p>Great, so my hand is awkwardly muting strings it's not supposed to mute, etc. I do not actually play guitar.)</p>
<p>It's nice to be able to comfortably sightread most non-classical piano pieces I come across. A more accurate term might be "fake sightreading" - I don't actually play all the notes (sometimes I play <i>more</i> than all the notes), I look at the sheet music, make an invisible fake-book in my head, and play from that, scaling the difficulty up or down as I need to. So I can leave off notes on chords that stretch my hands too much, or add a few turns of ornamentation during a boring section, in realtime, on music I've never seen or heard before. It... is... <i>awesome</i>. And I am totally on a plateau, but I'll enjoy this coasting while it lasts - just settling back and enjoying the chord changes on "The Nearness Of You" and "Round Midnight" and various Elton John / Stevie Wonder / Billy Joel transcriptions (what? I like their music). I'll often take a section mid-song and plunge it into the lower registers where I can hear <i>everything</i>, and then it just sounds (and feels) terrific. Mmm.</p>
<p>Today wasn't particularly productive - I was tired and sort of scattered-distracted, and music was the only thing that could hold my attention for any length of time. So I worked in short spurts broken into small tasks, and got into a longer sprint just now - started around 10pm, and it's now half-past midnight, and that's the first time I sat still not-at-the-piano-bench for more than 20 minutes at a time all day.&nbsp; (Tiredness helps; I just had to get worn-out enough to <i>sit</i>.) ADHD brain management is aggravating sometimes, but it's also an entertaining and grand adventure - and something you just deal with.</p>
<p>Time to clean the kitchen, look for my floor (I'm rediscovering it slowly as the piles of stuff begin to clear) and then sleep for a couple hours.</p>
