<p>Was sorting through my travel pictures this evening and found some older ones - two which I know I haven't posted here before, one which I've definitely mentioned but may not have put up.</p>
<p>The first two are class notes from ICB my freshman year with the legendary team of Burt and Zhenya. There's a page from physics and a page from math, respectively. The page from math eventually evolved into a half-length Shakespearean production of Rhomeo and Julihat. I say half-length because even if we eventually put it on (to a standing ovation) at the end-of-year exposition later that May, I stopped writing after the Rhomeo-kills-Phibalt scene and haven't been able to conclude it satisfactorily since (although I've tried to write the rest several times).<br />

<p>Yes, I actually used to take notes like that; these are my notes from high school physics with Ms. Nicks, done in the form of a comic book with references to a LOTR-style IMSA epic that my friends and I were writing on notesfiles (hence the characters, who are either fictional beasts or actual kids I went to school with, only with swords and snappy comebacks). <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/imsa-physics.pdf" title="Calc-based physics epic comic book">Calc-based physics epic comic book [pdf]</a></p>
<p>Someday I should make a nice gallery of this stuff online again.Â  The final picture is the dartboard from the "I chose my undergrad major using a dartboard" story. See? I wasn't kidding.</p>
