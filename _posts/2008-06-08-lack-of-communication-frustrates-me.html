<div>This is a rant. You have been warned.</p>
<p>Run this post through a <a href="http://www.rot13.com/">rot-13 translator</a> and it'll start making sense. For the most accurate results, you should run it through a rot-13 translator one line at a time before reading the next. (For sanity's sake, just do it all at once, though; I don't want you to go through undue pain.)</p>

<p>Okay. Now imagine having to do this ALL THE DAMN TIME. You now have a glimpse of the tip of the iceberg of my frustration during meetings that are conference calls. And large group meetings in general where I can't follow the lipreading bouncing across the room.</p>
<p>I'm tired of standing silent in the corner seething with the bursting desire to participate. The "I could be useful, if only I coud hear their questions and respond with my answers!" feeling. If I was smarter, I'd give up - I'd say "I don't do phone meetings."</p>
<p>I'm not smart enough to do that, though. So I'm going to keep on trying. I'm just trying to vent my aggravation here, and give some folks an understanding of why I might get frustrated during meetings - nothing to do the meeting or the people in it! It's the look of someone who wants to contribute but has to fight, alone, aÂ  continuous uphill battle in order to do so.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, I want to keep others from having to experience the same pain. This may explain some of my obsession with openness and transparency and documentation. I don't want other people to have to fight for information and the ability to communicate and participate because I know that fight is <em>painful</em>. And I will go through bloody hell myself in order to open things up for the next round of people who want to participate.</p>
<p>It's just frustrating, sometimes, the feeling of having to continually hack through the underbrush with a machete... often I don't feel like I have the option to walk a clear path, and my arm's getting tired, and I just want to lie back and rest and let someone else whack through the undergrowth for a change, while I stroll along enjoying the flowers.</p>
<p>Right. So I got that out of my system now. Back to work.</p>
