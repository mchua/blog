<p>Okay. Now imagine having to do this ALL THE DAMN TIME. You now have a glimpse of the tip of the iceberg of my frustration during meetings that are conference calls. And large group meetings in general where I can't follow the lipreading bouncing across the room.</p>
<p>I'm tired of standing silent in the corner seething with the bursting desire to participate. The "I could be useful, if only I coud hear their questions and respond with my answers!" feeling. If I was smarter, I'd give up - I'd say "I don't do phone meetings."</p>
<p>I'm not smart enough to do that, though. So I'm going to keep on trying. I'm just trying to vent my aggravation here, and give some folks an understanding of why I might get frustrated during meetings - nothing to do the meeting or the people in it! It's the look of someone who wants to contribute but has to fight, alone, a  continuous uphill battle in order to do so.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, I want to keep others from having to experience the same pain. This may explain some of my obsession with openness and transparency and documentation. I don't want other people to have to fight for information and the ability to communicate and participate because I know that fight is <em>painful</em>. And I will go through bloody hell myself in order to open things up for the next round of people who want to participate.</p>
<p>It's just frustrating, sometimes, the feeling of having to continually hack through the underbrush with a machete... often I don't feel like I have the option to walk a clear path, and my arm's getting tired, and I just want to lie back and rest and let someone else whack through the undergrowth for a change, while I stroll along enjoying the flowers.</p>
<p>Right. So I got that out of my system now. Back to work.</p>
