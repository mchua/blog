<p>Turns out I had a low-grade fever last night, which intensified early this morning; when my alarm rang at 6am, I decided to skip the Curriki breakfast and lie in bed until the fever broke, which it did about a half-hour ago. I'm going to rest by writing up the remainder of my notes from Monday now, then head back to NECC in the late morning. Feeling way better - aside from the nasal drip, I'm pretty much back to normal.</p>
<p>In other words, "I slept for 8 hours this morning, so that means I was sick, but I think I've mostly gotten better." Excellent.</p>
