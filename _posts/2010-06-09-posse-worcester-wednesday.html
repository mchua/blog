<p>The email I sent my team today as a "what did Mel do?" update:</p>
<blockquote><p>00:18&nbsp; * mchua has had a great day.<br />00:19 &lt; mchua&gt; When college professors start high-fiving each other across the classroom like excited kids because they got a button to work on a Sugar Activity, it is a Good Day.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm too behind/tired to be more verbose - turns out it's difficult to simultaneously teach at and document a <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE">POSSE</a> (probably due to that blasted 3 hours of driving per day - will hopefully do better next week). But betwen Friday noon and Sunday at 6 when the RIT one starts, I'll spew logs from this one.<b><br /></b></p>
<p><b>Theme:</b> "Development"</p>
<p><b>Big idea:</b> Sometimes, you've just got to dive in and work  on the code... together. </p>
<p><b>Skill:</b> Making contributions to an open source project "in  the wild." (In this case, the <a href="http://git.sugarlabs.org/projects/measure">Measure Activity</a>.)</p>
<p><b>Full logs:</b>  </p>

</ul>
<p>Of the three, the notes for the last one are the most interesting - the notes for maddog's talk are essentially a paraphrased (brief) transcript of his 1.5 hour presentation on "how FOSS teaches you twice."</p>
