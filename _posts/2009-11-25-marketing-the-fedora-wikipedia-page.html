<p><i>Originally on but I was amused and wanted to share.</i></p>
<p>Right before F12 released, Robyn asked the Marketing mailing list if anyone wanted to update the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_%28operating_system%29#Releases">Fedora wikipedia page</a>. I took another look at it just now, and from the history, looks like  Zvn, GurkLurk, Pmiossec, Antonio Lopez, Chargh, (and some guy named Paul  Frields, who's that? ;-) took care of it. </p>
<p>If we consider this Marketing work (and in a way, it is) and wonder who the contributors to this were, well... one is from Sweden, one is from France, one is from  Canada, one is 14 years old, one plays the euphonium, one is a cattle  farmer... </p>
<p>Open source and open content communities rock.</p>
