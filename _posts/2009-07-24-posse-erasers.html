<p><a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_2009">POSSE</a> week is over. Everyone has headed home, happy and exhausted. Honestly, I can't say much more coherent stuff about POSSE right now - there's too much in my brain to sort out after a mindboggling week of work that rewired a lot of my thinking about open source in academic contexts - but the summary is "open source in higher education is going to <i>work</i> - it's going to be more wonderful than I could ever have imagined before this week - and it's going to take a lot more time and work than I could ever have concieved." I'll come back to this with better notes after my brain is decompressed.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I will leave you with a picture of our final bit of swag. Which every classroom ought to have, in my biased opinion.</p>
