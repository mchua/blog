<p>When you begin working on a computer peripheral,  </p>
<p>And then spend two days building the hardware,  <br />And a week on the firmware,<br />And three days on the software,<br />all developed separately and tested and all that good stuff,</p>
<p>And you spend hours tracking down bugs and whacking your head against the wall and being really confused by datasheets and re-reading Kernighan & Ritchie and accidentally melting two connectors with an overzealous soldering iron and feeling idiotic for your sheer lack of productivity,</p>
<p>And then you double-check that your hardware and software and firmware are spitting out and taking in the inputs they're supposed to, albeit into simulators or printfs or mostly thin air,<br />And then you plug everything together for the first time and hit the button nervously,</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">AND IT WORKS THE FIRST TIME,</span><br />there is no greater feeling in the world.</p>
<p>My entire last 3 weeks of existence have just been validated.</p>
<p>Now it's time to make this baby do some really cool stuff.<br />...like documentation for my reams of code, and schlepping a final PCB together, and trying to make the serial port cooperate, but hey; that's later.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm just going to bask in the glow of functionality. I made a Gadget Thingy. And it Works Good. That's enough for me.</p>
