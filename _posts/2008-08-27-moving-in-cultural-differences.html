<p><i>(walking out of Super 88, our local Asian supermarket)</i></p>
<p><b>Me:</b> Whoa,   I have a rice cooker <i>and</i> a wok. I feel like a real grown-up now.<br /><b>Chris:</b> For me, it's more like "I have my own skillet!"<br /><b>Me:</b> Yeah, I'm Chinese.</p>
<p><i>(in the grocery store, international aisle)</i></p>
<p><b>Me:</b> *immediately walks over to sesame oil / soy sauce section*<br /><b>Chris:</b> *has moved to stand in front of the olive oil / balsamic vinegar rack*</p>
<p><i>(later, while unpacking all our boxes)</i></p>
<p><b>Chris:</b> You know, it feels really weird to be doing this right now.<br /><b>Mel:</b> Oh yeah.<br /><b>Chris:</b> All of my friends from high school got their own apartments after, like, their freshman year of college, so they've all done this already, years ago.<br /><b>Mel:</b> Whoa. I was going to say that it was sort of early to not be living with my parents because I'm not married, but... yes. </p>
<p>Also, I've never complimented a company on the packaging of their toilet<br />
plungers before, but OXO is smart; they sonic-weld their plastic case<br />
around the plunger, but include some handy perforations so you can,<br />
with one deft motion and <i>no tools</i>, extract your doodad from its case. Yay good design!</p>
<p>And also also, Chris is wonderful. Our apartment is a no-shoes zone; we have a shoe-rack by the door. I'm happy because I can traipse around barefoot and still have clean feet.</p>
<p>The unpacking continues.</p>
