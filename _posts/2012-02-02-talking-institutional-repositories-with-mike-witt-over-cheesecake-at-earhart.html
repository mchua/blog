<p>Today was a busy day. Over lunch, Purdue Librarian Mike Witt regaled me with historic tales of the early days of Purdue's institutional repository (IR). He should know: he started and spearheaded it. He's also the CS librarian and a huge open access advocate, which explains another reason why we were sitting across from each other in the dormitory dining hall, chattering busily between mouthfuls of strawberry cheesecake. (Purdue visitors: Earhart Hall has an incredibly impressive repast. I would go again. Recommended!)</p>
<blockquote><p>"The point of an institutional repository's collection policy is so that you can say no."</p></blockquote>
<p>It's not about what you <em>will</em> collect, it's about what you won't collect - how you <em>don't</em> want to use your limited resources. Lunch with Mike was a joy; his casual comments (because he's deeply embedded in his field) expanded to a wealth of information when I tracked them down. For instance, the <a href="http://pantonprinciples.org/">Panton Principles</a> (rationale for open data) - how did I not see this before?</p>
<p>I learned a lot about how someone <em>thinks</em> about an institutional repository. (I know it's one view out of many possible ones, but still - getting a rich slice of that one view was extremely useful.) Content in Purdue's IR is organized the same way its departments are organized; interdisciplinary research usually comes out of Discovery Park and goes in its corner of the repository. There are common actions that an IR's workflow should handle well: consuming (downloading someone else's papers), submitting (sending in your own), accepting (what it sounds like), and batching (creating collections of papers). Make sure you check and know all four.</p>
<p>Mike confirmed some other things I had been thinking about, like how catering to faculty self-interest ("ah, I can track publication downloads and use this for my tenure case!") actually works well. <em>Mandating</em> something that should ostensibly be in faculty's self-interest ("only publications listed in the IR count for your tenure evaluation!") is... hard, and I'm not sure if I agree with that goal (I still live in a dream world where people do good things without being required to do them, apparently) but it's got an undeniable impact on compliance rates.</p>
<p>On the way back, he introduced me to the work of <a href="http://jasonpriem.org/blog/">Jason Priem</a>, who looks at altmetrics - can we more accurately measure scholarly impact if we look at social media instead of merely journal citations? - and whose <a href="http://jasonpriem.org/2011/02/open-access-3-koans/">open access koans</a> made me grin. Apparently Jason is speaking at Purdue in 2 weeks - I'm totally going. And apparently Jason is getting his PhD at the same place as <a href="http://stillnotcool.com">Bryan Behrenshausen</a>, last summer's opensource.com intern (and the man <a href="http://opensource.com/education/11/7/voices-posse-part-1-theory-practice">behind</a> <a href="http://opensource.com/education/11/8/posse-professors-discover-values-open-source">the</a> <a href="http://opensource.com/education/11/8/collaborative-open-source-summer-experience-professors-forge-community-practice">POSSE</a> <a href="http://opensource.com/education/11/8/sharing-open-source-projects-professors-teach-importance-giving-back">profiles</a> from last summer - we're currently having a <a href="http://lists.teachingopensource.org/pipermail/tos/2012-February/004804.html">debate about the future of POSSE</a>, by the way).</p>
<p>My brain is swimming -- and I haven't even started my German translation homework yet. It's been a good, good day. Extremely good. A day full of The Learn.</p>
