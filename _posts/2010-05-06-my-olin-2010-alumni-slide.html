<p>Olin has this thing for slideshows. When you come for Candidates' Weekend (the final round in the admissions process), they ask you to submit a slide about yourself so they can throw everyone's deck up on the wall and flip through it as a fast way of getting to know people. And once you graduate, the tradition (such as it is) continues at alumni reunions - which, since all our alumni are still young and for the most part know the graduating class (the 5th one, this year!), tends to be around Commencement.</p>
<p>The text I submitted for my Candidates' Weekend slide when I was 16:</p>
<blockquote><p>Energetic, hardly tires<br />
Seen with pencil, or else pliers<br />
Likes computers, fond of rhymes<br />
Climbs trees, sleeps... sometimes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently, not much has changed in the meantime, including my tendency to haphazardly slap text together for submission at the last moment. (My CW slide process: "AAH! It's due! Quick, Sharon (my high school roommate), take a picture of me!" *TYPE TYPE TYPE SUBMIT!*)</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2010_olinslide.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Also, it was extremely difficult to find photos of me from the last year - I guess I really do avoid cameras like the plague. Also also, I did not make the slide layout, I'm just using it.<br />
Edit: found slides from the past two years! (And yes, I'm 23; I was the youngest in the class of '07.)</p>
<p>2009:<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2321" title="olinslide-2009" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/olinslide-2009.png" alt="" width="550" height="412" /></p>
<p>2008:<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2322" title="olinslide_2008" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/olinslide_2008.png" alt="" width="561" height="423" /></p>
<p>So yes. I still don't know how to fill in the "location" section for these slides.</p>
