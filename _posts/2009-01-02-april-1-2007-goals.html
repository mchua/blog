<p><em>I've mentioned this list in an <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2008/11/30/inbox-cleaning-192763/">earlier post</a>. It's from April 2007,   from when someone asked me what my goals were, and I realized I hadn't really written them down,   so I sat down and typed 'em up. This was a nonchalantly-made list, but it's still a good one - and it's neat to see how my priorities have changed. And for the record, I've done almost everything in the timeline that I said I wanted to do.</em></p>
<p>I'm 20 and graduate from college at the end of May. I don't know what I want to do with my life, but I'll type what I can anyway.</p>
<p>In 2 months, I want to:</p>
<ul>
<li> have graduated from college with my electrical engineering degree - by a good margin, not just barely. (currently: barely) <strong>(2009: Got it.)</strong></li>
<li>have developed a stable strategy for dealing with ADHD (currently: denial) and a study plan for bolstering the areas in EE and CS I feel I'm weak on (currently: everything). <strong>(2009: These will always be ongoing efforts, but I'm satisfied with progress so far.)</strong></li>
<li>be on good parting terms with my professors and classmates - more on my part than theirs; I want to tie up loose ends with people I feel I've let down in some way during my four years here. <strong>(2009: Yes.)</strong></li>
<li>have said thank you everyone who's touched my life at college. <strong>(2009: Yes. And I still thank them.)</strong></li>
<li>have an intelligently designed financial and savings infrastructure, including the beginnings of investment for retirement, which is independent from my parents' finances... and includes a monthly allowance for books. <strong>(2009: The monthly books allowance was folded into a general 'discretionary stuff' fund, but otherwise, yes.)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In 2 years, I want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>be fluent in at least one non-English language (currently: shaky Japanese and very rudimentary spoken Mandarin). <strong>(2009: I'm not quite fluent, but I could shakily read Chinese newspapers at the end of being in Shanghai, and that's not bad for 2 weeks of grueling study.)</strong></li>
<li>have contributed substantially in a technical way to at least one open-source software project. <strong>(2009: I'm... pretty sure this has been covered very nicely. I've dreamed of contributing to OSS since I was in high school. It just took me many years to get involved.)</strong></li>
<li>be living in my own place (probably with roommates), not with my parents or an older relative as is the custom in my family. <strong>(2009: Maker House and Yavin IV. Next stop: Who knows?)</strong></li>
<li>be a regular practitioner of Tai Chi or some other martial art. <strong>(2009: Sanda.)</strong></li>
<li>be able to run 2 miles in under 15 minutes and/or do 100 push-ups. <strong>(2009: Uh... working on this one.)</strong></li>
<li>have developed and released at least one open-source hardware project (probably a circuit design with microcontroller code). <strong>(2009: In progress, doing nicely.)</strong></li>
<li>have edited at least 100 Wikipedia articles. <strong>(2009: No longer actually a goal. I got my wiki kicks on the OLPC wiki.)</strong></li>
<li>have gone on a date. (have gotten over my phobia about relationships.) <strong>(2009: No longer actually a goal. It's not a phobia - I actually <em>don't care</em> about having that kind of a relationship. It's not because I'm afraid of dates that I don't go on them. And that's okay, and I'll live with the flak I get from it.)</strong></li>
<li>have started on my round-the-world trip to learn about engineering education (a long story; ask if you'd like to hear it).<strong> (2009: Done for the first round - I want to do it again, more purposefully, now that I see what traveling is like - yay, spiral learning!)<br />
</strong></li>
<li>be able to go on a solo week-long backpacking trip (currently: have never backpacked) <strong>(2009: Must visit Andrew for spring break.)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In 20 years, I want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>have gotten or be en route to my PhD in a technical field (may get a degree in education or design first, though)</li>
<li>have started a startup (or joined one very early).</li>
<li>have written a book.</li>
<li>have gone on at least one cross-country bike trip (currently: have never biked more than 8 miles).</li>
<li>have taught a college course. (currently: hope to become a professor)</li>
<li>have a treehouse. preferably self-built.</li>
<li>have done at least one of the following: bungee jumped, hang glided, gone on the vomit comet, or flown a plane/copter.</li>
<li>have worked or lived in a non-US country, preferably a developing country, for at least a year.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I retire, I want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>not really retire, but have enough financial security to volunteer-work wherever I want.</li>
<li>have mentored at least several young people closely</li>
<li>be alive, active, and healthy.</li>
<li>own a house or building which I've built or seriously modified myself, which has living space, a workshop, a great kitchen, studio space, etc. and serves as a locale for informal interdisciplinary classes on all sorts of intellectual subjects.</li>
<li>travel, a-la Erdos, visiting friends and colleagues to tinker on random projects.</li>
<li>have seen engineering education become a legitimate field of study.</li>
<li>have seen design and design education become rigorous, well-known areas of research.</li>
<li>have made knowledge more broadly accessible to all people with the desire to learn, somehow.</li>
</ul>
