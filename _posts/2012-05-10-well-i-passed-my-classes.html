<p>Not only did I pass my classes, an A+, and a B. That was carrying 13 graduate credits (4 classes and an independent study) at a place where a full load is 3 classes (9 credits).</p>
<p>What. The. <em>Hell.</em></p>
<p>Yes, I'm sure some of this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome</a> speaking, but... but... I feel like I did that with luck, not skill or planning. Luck, and panic and last-minute scrambling and trying not to cry so I could see the papers I was writing at 3 in the morning. My apartment looks like a bomb filled with academic papers exploded in it, which is pretty close to the truth; the materials cited for all 4 of my term papers are sprawled everywhere -- desks, tables, kitchen counter, floor, stacked on stools, across the sofa... I'm eating breakfast atop a drift of papers that's 2 inches thick in some places.</p>
<p>I can perform at this level (so far), but I'm not turning out anywhere near the quality of work I could. I see it when I look at my writing; there are logical flaws I can fix now, holes in my research I know how to patch, places where my arguments are weak, though these are often obscured behind a plaster of fluent writing (the ability to bullshit is both a blessing and a curse). Therefore: ADHD coping strategies! And medication, now; I started with Strattera yesterday and am trying to get used to my brain having a different sort of <em>inertia</em> than I'm used to, though it's also early and the effects haven't kicked in fully yet.</p>
<p>One of the things that's shifted this year is the way I see myself. I'm an engineer. I grew into becoming one, and now I <em>am</em> one, and ought to be confident in that; I don't know everything, but can always learn what I need to know. And I'll always be an engineer; I have that now. But right now, I am not doing engineering as a <em>career</em>. (Well, not much; there's often a little something on the side, but it's not my full-time focus like it used to be.)</p>
<p>Instead, I'm a researcher and a writer. It's kind of odd to realize that. I'm <em>actually</em> a writer; this is now what I do professionally -- if you think about what academics get evaluated on, it's <em>mostly</em> stuff that's formatted in text. I'm a writer that has domain-specific knowledge (in engineering and engineering education) that I need to have and hone and keep updated in order to write well -- but at the end of the day, I am a writer now, and that's pretty cool. (Katrina -- it took me a decade to get here, but I'm here!)</p>
<p>So I need to stop worrying about things like "but... but I don't understand signal processing yet!" and actually focus on training in <em>this</em> craft, the craft of writing, the craft of being a scholar. This doesn't mean I'm going to lose touch with making and doing (that would be... hard) but it does mean I will also be thinking of them as a means to better writing as well as a satisfying end in and of themselves.</p>
<p>And then maybe, this summer and this fall and into the next year, I can start producing writing that I'm proud of.</p>
