<p>(If someone can translate and post this to the <a href="http://planet.fedora-zh.org/">zh-language Fedora Planet</a>, that would be awesome!)</p>
<p>I'm about to board a plane to Shanghai - I'll be in China for a week devoting my time towards building up Fedora activities and presence in the region. If you're in <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/chinese">FZUG</a>, in the area, or interested in the region, please let me know! I will be in #fedora-zh all week (I usually lurk there anyway) and trying to improve my (very basic) Mandarin skills, but will probably need a lot of translation help.</p>
<p>This trip was originally supposed to be a POSSE (more on that later) but that was unexpectedly canceled at the last moment - it's actually a good thing, though, because we'll have more of a chance to get to know what's happening in the area.</p>
<p>One area I'm personally interested in is education, mostly at the college level - for instance, it would be great to see a <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE">POSSE</a> (workshop for professors interested in getting their students involved as contributors to open source communities) in China sometime in the next two years, and I would love to talk with people about how we can make this happen.</p>
<p>However, my first priority on this trip are the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors">Ambassadors</a> and folks working on the ground for Fedora in the region.  How can we do a better job of getting you resources, how can we get more publicity on Planet and Ambassadors-list regarding what is happening in the region?  Do we have a lot of packagers, or translators, of $SKILLSET in the region that we should organize a <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FAD">FAD</a> around? Who should we talk to? Where should we go? Do people want to meet up for dinner some evening?</p>
<p>In other words, what are Linux users in China passionate about, and how can Fedora help them?  Blank slate.</p>
