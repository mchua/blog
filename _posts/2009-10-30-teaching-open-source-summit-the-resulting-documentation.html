<p>For those interested in open source in higher education...</p>
<p>The Teaching Open Source Summit (TOSS) and the Free Software and Open Source Symposium (FSOSS) it was a pre-conference to have finished, and <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/Teaching_Open_Source_Summit_2009-10-29/TOSS09#Notes">notes are up</a> from both the full day of TOSS and the TOS session at FSOSS, replete with plenty of whiteboard pictures. Thanks to everyone who helped with notes, from IRC backchannel transcription to whiteboard scribing to photographing to transcribing notes to editing the wiki page, and everything else that's going to be helpful for posterity.</p>
<p>Here's one of our whiteboards - the link to the notes has many more. This one is the "what is needed?" project voting board.</p>

<p>Now it's <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/mailman/listinfo/tos">off to the mailing list</a> to see what happens next.</p>
