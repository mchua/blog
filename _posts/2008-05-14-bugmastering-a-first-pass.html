<p>Yes, this is a poorly written post. I am on the verge of unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Right before going to bed (now), noting that the location is unstable and this link probably won't lead you to those notes after a few days.</p>
<p>I didn't actually touch things in Trac because many scattered changes may be hard to undo, and I want to run this by people for a sanity check first. There are  plenty of questions on that page, and what I've done is almost certainly  suboptimal bugmastering-fu; I am throwing this out there for feedback on how I can  improve the usefulness of what I just did (it took about an hour to read  all the existing bug reports and write those notes).</p>
<p>In general, I was trying to piece together a rough idea of the problems the Sugar team is trying to solve. Some have been neglected (standing untouched for months). Some are confusingly written or overly terse such that only a handful of very-involved developers would be able to understand what it meant. Most were unverified. Some were probably duplicates (though I didn't look too hard for those). Much cleanup is almost certainly needed; I need to talk with the Sugar folks about what they're trying to do first.</p>
<p>I am not sure if this is helpful or if I'm the best person to do it even if it <i>is</i> helpful, but I told Bernie I'd try it out for two weeks and see if I could figure out how to be useful.</p>
