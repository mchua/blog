<p>I found, to my delight, that the New England Conservatory has free music (classical! jazz!) <a href="http://concerts.newenglandconservatory.edu/">concerts and workshops</a> just about every day. I'm going to try to go to the jazz recital on Tuesday, if anyone's around and wants to be a music geek with me at 8:30pm.</p>
<p>After a great deal of practice over the past week, a confusing-in-a-good-way lesson, and a day of "why <i>isn't</i> the way I'm practicing this making me better at what I want to learn?" reflection, I think I've come up with a way to learn how to solo on "Well You Needn't" in an unscripted, non-robotic fashion. (My current methodology: left hand comping, right hand occasionally frantically stabbing at random notes on the F blues scale. This does not sound particularly good.) I need to write this down to solidify what I learned and what I'm going to do; when I'm confused, I write. Text is my input/output mode for making sense of what bewilders me.</p>
<p>I gave up alcohol for Lent; I'm also only eating meat one meal a day. As the weeks of Lent go by, I'll see if I can decrease this to N meals per week - most of this is an "other people cooked me meat" thing, but I am trying to be "as vegetarian as comfortably possible." I find myself preferring vegetarian food and lighter meals these days, though I'm still a total sucker for excellent steaks and roasts and anything involving prosciutto. (And cheese-stuffed pasta with a heavy cream-based sauce. Mmmm.)</p>
<p>Last night I was at Mauna Loa and went with them to a (free and very good) negotiation workshop that turned out to be based on "Getting to Yes." I learned two things from this. The first is that I'm still a math dork. As an exercise, the speaker held an auction for a $20 bill based on a twisted set of rules; the MBA alumni jumped in immediately and ended up in a bidding war over who would get to pay far more than $20 for a $20 bill, with the price climbing. My first reaction was to work out a proof for the optimal strategy for the game to maximize your earnings from it to the nearest cent. (Downside: by the time I finished the proof, the bidding had already escalated to ridiculousness. However, the proof was a general one for a Nash equilibrium for the game at any point in time, so it could have been used to cut their losses.)</p>
<p>The second thing I learned was what my dad has tried to tell me for years; I shouldn't be this underconfident about my negotiation abilities. I always thought that I was too young, inexperienced, had crippling blind spots, and "didn't know" how to "negotiate properly." Watching the workshop and the MBAs in it convinced me that I wasn't missing any magic. They didn't know any better, they just had more practice and experience. I probably have blind spots still, but they won't kill me. And others will probably have those blind spots too. And I can find them and get over them. With that, I now believe I can learn how to negotiate by negotiating; there are no prerequisites I'm missing before I can start. (And heck, I've been haggling since I was a little kid at garage sales and the tiangge. What was I so worried about?)</p>
<p>Then I went out to consult with a few friends who are doing a startup (we have an agreement; I consult for them as long as they're feeding me dinner - from when the food appears to when I finish my last forkful). My job is best described as "kicking their asses." I give them blunt and scathing criticism about <i>everything</i>. It's good for me to learn how to criticize the operations of a business in a clear and actionable way, and apparently they think it's helped them too, since they keep feeding me. And by uncovering their blind spots, sometimes I discover and clarify my own. (This paragraph is vague for confidentiality, but if they open-source their product*, this will change.)</p>
<p>*...working on it. I'm pretty convinced they should - it makes the most business sense, as best as I can tell. But I am biased.</p>
