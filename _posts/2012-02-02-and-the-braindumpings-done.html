<p>As you can tell from my posts today - my brain is overflowing,   and I'm trying to get it out so I can process it all. It's nearly 9pm and I should go home, eat dinner, work on a side project, sleep... but it feels good to have my mind clear, my plate clear, to not worry that I won't remember something later. Clearly I need to balance out this tradeoff more, but... I'm not in a bad place right now. I'm actually in a pretty good one. The trick, as always, is to see what happens when the pace picks up.</p>
<p>Had one of those "wait, how did 4 hours pass, and is it really 3am now?" conversations with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/mark-penner/14/207/875">Mark</a> last night; there's something satisfying in the sort of friendship where you can go months without contact and still know you'll be slugging it out, no-holds-barred, over your new ideas and directions within a few minutes of starting to talk again. I give him shit, he gives me shit, and we thereby keep each other honest.</p>
<p><a href="http://sdziallas.com">Sebastian</a> sent me "WAT," a brilliant <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">5-minute lightning talk</a> on programming languages that left me howling with laughter. Via <a href="http://blog.karl.w-sts.com/">Karl Wurst</a> came an insightful blog post on <a href="http://blog.karl.w-sts.com/2012/02/01/oh-no-im-defaulting-to-closed">defaulting to closed</a> and  <a href="http://profshonle.blogspot.com/2011/05/why-i-will-randomly-assign-students-in.html">Macneil Shonle's "Why I Will Randomly Assign Students in Group Projects."</a> Fellow Olin alum <a href="http://katie.rivard.org/">Katie Rivard</a> pointed me to <a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/academicus-mentor/up-the-ivy/#review">Up The Ivy</a>, an old satire of academic culture.</p>
<p>And now it's time for coffeehouse decompression with Velvet and Nikitha. Mmm... quiet time.</p>
