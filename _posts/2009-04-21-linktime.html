<p>Via <a href="http://lostinthegroove.net/wordpress/?p=261">DJ</a>: why is <a href="http://9a4440c5.fb.joyent.us/haggadah/ultraModern2.php">this Haggadah</a> different from all other Haggadahs?</p>
<p>If you want to hear great music this Wednesday night, go listen to <a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2009/04/17/for_jazz_trio_a_conversation_in_musical_notes/">Kevin's trio</a>. Kevin is my piano teacher, and he rocks; hearing him and Steve together is a steady stream of "stand there with jaw open... whoa, what was that <i>sound?" </i>moments. I didn't know what a musical conversation sounded like until I heard those two play off each other.</p>
<p>As the co-creator of robotfindssharon (set in my high school dorm room, hunting for my roommate), I was happily surprised to learn that Leonard was the creator of the original <a href="http://www.robotfindskitten.org/">robotfindskitten</a> that inspired it. The world, she is small.</p>
<p>Good posture is awesome-tastic, and my hands have been dramatically improving. Many thanks to Nagle for introducing me to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yYJ4hEYudE">Esther Gokhale</a>'s work and lending me his Feldenkrais book, and Sondy for insisting that I talk with <a href="http://abiharper.com/">Abi</a>, who worked on my back for the first time today and <i>oh man I can move my right shoulder this is so cool.</i> Also, how did my <i>collarbone</i> get tight? Yeesh. And my neck feels longer now... and I'm aware of more individual muscles that need work instead of having everything buried in a morass of "well, I'm carrying tension around just about everywhere." My shoulders were so wound up that they clickety-clacked in tight bunches. There's plenty more to do; I'm going back.</p>
<p>Discovering my body and my hearing - in the same way I discovered math, physics, writing... things to explore, to play with - is a wonderful thing.</p>
