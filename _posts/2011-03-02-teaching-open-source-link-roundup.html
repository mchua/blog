<p>Things I've seen recently that I think others interested in open source and education will enjoy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mark has written a <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/rhevm-api/wiki/Email_Guidelines">fantastic guide to open source project email etiquette</a>.</li>
<li>One motivation I've heard from professors incorporating open source into their classrooms is that it attracts a broader demographic, in particular, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ac/20110212/us_ac/7838406_can_free_opensource_software_bridge_the_gender_gap_in_technology">bridging the gender gap</a>. I mean, we still see <a href="http://geekfeminism.org/2011/02/24/quick-hit-my-mom-has-a-phd-in-math/">tech ads like this</a>, so there's quite a ways to go.</li>
<li>Nicholas <a href="http://imperialwicket.com/getting-started-in-open-source-part-2-where-can-i-take-these-courses">writes out the course catalog</a> he wishes were available for people looking for a study pathway into open source contribution. We'll have to draw on some of his recommendations for the design of <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_modules">POSSE modules</a>, for sure.</li>
<li>There are a ridiculous number of <a href="http://www.shallowsky.com/linux/LinuxPresentations.html">open source presentation tools</a> that I'll have to try out at some point. You can make slides with <a href="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/slides/current/doc/">DocBook-based XML</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_%28LaTeX%29">LaTeX</a>, <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">JavaScript</a>, <a href="http://www.timteatro.net/2010/08/12/a-tutorial-introduction-to-jessyink-presentations-in-inkscape/">Inkscape</a>, and... <a href="http://member.wide.ad.jp/wg/mgp/">MagicPoint</a>, which I don't know how else to describe.</li>
<li>Paul on <a href="http://paul.frields.org/2011/03/01/defaulting-to-open/">defaulting to open</a>, a key piece of open source culture that's easy to say but hard to do. "Not this time... every other time, but just not this time..." goes the temptation during the situations you <em>most</em> need to open up.</li>
</ul>
