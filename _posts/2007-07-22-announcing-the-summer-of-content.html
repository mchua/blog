<p>Some of you have asked what I've been up to the last few weeks. Thanks to a late-night wiki cleanup crew (thanks, Nikki, Andy, and SJ!) we are finally ready to go live.</p>
<p>So without further ado... I proudly present the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Summer_of_Content">Summer of Content</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>(SoCon), a collaboration between <a href="http://www.laptop.org/">OLPC </a>and the <a href="http://www.col.org/colweb/site">Commonwealth of Learning</a>. In a nutshell, we match interns who want to contribute to open content with mentors from existing open-content projects who can help them, while providing stipends to the interns that allow them to work full-time on their project.</p>
<p>SoCon runs two summers a year, one for each hemisphere. This summer is the Northern Summer pilot, with projects running from <span style="font-weight: bold;">August 10 - September 24. </span>Groups like <a href="http://google.com/">Google </a>and <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora </a>are already on board. We're ridiculously excited and can't wait to get started.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What's the Summer of Content?</p>
<p></span>It's kind of like <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2007/">Summer of Code</a>, minus the code, plus a few key differences (below text mostly lifted from the stuff I wrote for the website).<br /><b><br />We're aiming for the inverse demographic.</b></p>
<p>The Summer of Code program has <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2005/map.html" class="external text" title="http://code.google.com/soc/2005/map.html" rel="nofollow">traditionally attracted</a> a large number of individual students with technical backgrounds from the developed world. By making our stipend $500 instead of $5000 and allowing teams to apply together, we're hoping to attract an even larger number of collaborating creators from the developing world - including non-students and people with non-technical backgrounds.<b></p>
<p>Collaboration is good.</p>
<p></b>I mentioned above that you can apply in teams. I'd like to point it out again. Actually, applying in teams only helps your chances. (The catch is that the team all has to split a single stipend, but if you come from the developing world, that's still pretty good money.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Emphasis on joining the community, not cranking out a product.</p>
<p></span>You do have to get <span style="font-style: italic;">something</span> done. But we're going to make it very clear that the <span style="font-style: italic;">real</span> job of the interns is to learn how to work with a particular content community, not to act as a contractor that just churns out stuff for them in exchange for pay. There are <span style="font-style: italic;">people</span> involved. Get to know them. Collaborate.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span><b><br />"Content" doesn't just mean Content.</b></p>
<p>We're aiming to nurture a self-supporting networked ecosystem of projects. In other words, in addition to more traditional content-production projects (write a book, curate an encyclopedia, compose a piece of music, etc) there will be <i>meta-content</i> projects - for instance, accessibility and documentation projects with interns whose jobs will be to publicize, disseminate, and make other SoCon projects more accessible to various populations.</p>
<p>There will also be event/testing projects with interns whose jobs will be to run Test <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Jams" title="Jams">Jams</a> and other local free culture conferences/events to get feedback to other SoCon creators about the work they're producing. Other types of projects will also be encouraged, but the important point to note is that SoCon is not just about the creation of open content, but instead about making that content useful and accessible and therefore used for Awesome purposes by the rest of the world.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">We're hiring, and we need help!</p>
<p></span>We're looking for <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Summer_of_Content_mentors">mentor organizations</a>, <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Summer_of_Content_mentors">mentors</a>, and <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Summer_of_Content_interns">interns</a> as well as <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Summer_of_Content_volunteers">volunteers</a>. Check out the current <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Summer_of_Content_projects">project proposals</a> (better yet, suggest your own)!</p>
<p>The deadline for applications this round is <span style="font-weight: bold;">August 6</span>, so please help us spread the word - if you're interested or know anyone who might be, there are some <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Summer_of_Content/Letter_templates">template letters</a> you can use. We're especially looking for non-English-speaking organizations, mentors, and interns, and for participants from the developing world.</p>
<p>We also have an immediate need for volunteer <span style="font-weight: bold;">translators </span>- if you can help us translate the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Summer_of_Content_2007">website</a> into your language, please <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User_talk:Mchua">contact me</a>. We're especially looking for people who can do Amharic, Arabic, Hindi, Nepali, Portuguese, Thai, and Urdu.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Questions? Thoughts? Ideas?</p>
<p></span>We'd love to hear what you think. Leave a comment on this blog or a message on the official <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Talk:Summer_of_Content_2007">Summer of Content Talk Page</a>, and we'll get back to you (make sure we have your contact info, though).<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
