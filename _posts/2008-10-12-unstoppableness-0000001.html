<p>After several days of fiddling with lock picks on my train rides to/from work, I look much less like I'm trying to kill something compared to my <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2008/10/09/what-i-taught-myself-after-work-today/">first picking attempt</a> on Thursday. I still have some ways to go in developing a lighter touch, but for 4 days of learning, I'm pretty happy.</p>

<p>Note use of not-a-tension-wrench as tension wrench. I'm looking for Something Slimmer Than The Tension Wrench I Have because it makes it tough for me to get a non-rake pick in there. Also, this little hook has now become my favorite pick so far; it lets me feel what's going on inside the lock the most. It's pretty neat - I've started to be able to feel when I'm underneath a pin and can push up; my sensitivity to this is still incredibly crude, but at least it's started.</p>
