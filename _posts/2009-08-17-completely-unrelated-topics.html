<p><em>Actually from last night; actual posting was interrupted by small child.</em></p>
<p>Via Becky Scholl Hayden:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/325/5942/866">The Transcriptional Repressor DEC2 Regulates Sleep Length in Mammals</a>: We have identified a mutation in a transcriptional repressor (hDEC2-P385R) that is associated with a human short sleep phenotype. Activity profiles and sleep recordings of transgenic mice carrying this mutation showed increased vigilance time and less sleep time than control mice in a zeitgeber time– and sleep deprivation–dependent manner.</p></blockquote>
<p>This completely made my day; I think we both had a good laugh over it.</p>
<p>Completely unrelated topic: I've missed a house stuffed to the gills with people. Huge dinners with mishmashes of pitched-in food, overlapping instrumentation (simultaneously playing piano and teaching guitar), sitting on the sofa with two cousins giggling wildly as they paint my toenails alternating red and glitter-green. (It makes them happy, and I know where the bottle of non-acetone remove-this-stuff-zomg-now solution is.)</p>
<p>Completely unrelated topic: Matt Ritter, you are awesome. I got back from the Freedom Trail today to find my inbox utterly <em>stuffed</em> with marketing resources. (Matt is my roommate and works for an <a href="http://urgentvc.com/">urban sustainability venture capital firm.</a>)</p>
<p>Completely unrelated topic: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Putt-Putt-Enters-Race-Pc/dp/B00002S6E4">Putt-Putt Enters The Race</a> has just demonstrated that my 5-year-old cousin has better hand-mouse-eye coordination than I do. I've also been told that I am "okay on the wii, for a grown-up." (Hey, I fell off the edge of Rainbow Road far less frequently the 2nd time I played it. Give me some credit, guys. I'm learning this.)</p>
<p><em>Ok, lunch over; deliverable-crankin' time... and where is that nail-polish remover?</em></p>
