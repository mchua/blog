<p>This post is a summary of a rather lengthy article from the Inside Higher Education weblog on summarized:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: bold;">Doing nothing is <span style="font-style: italic;">always </span>easier and less risky.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Universities are competitive. </span>They're rarely rewarded for collaboration, so they typically don't do it. Individuals are competitive; tend to be more loyal to their subunit (department, lab, research group) than to the university as a whole.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tradition.</span> (Alumni especially.) Budget allocations, faculty unions, and faculty hiring procedures also support the status quo.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Assessment and accountability are viewed as horrible bothers</span>, not potentially helpful feedback.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">External $upport for higher education has dropped</span> in the last decade, so we have less resources to take risks with.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Higher education leaders aren't trained</span> on how to change their institutions, and may not see the value in doing so. Typically, administrators are taught how to preserve the "grand old status quo."</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The "bubble" effect</span> - we don't interface with the outside world that we're supposed to serve and prepare our students for.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, at most institutions, any attempt to implement a major academic innovation has been perceived by a majority of faculty as a temporary discomfort that will simply vanish if they stay the course and do nothing. Reinforcing this behavior pattern is the fact that there are rarely any serious consequences for behaving in this manner.</p></blockquote>
<p>How do we change this? Here's what they say.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Political leaders</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">and agencies</span> need to take action, not just in words but in deeds (resource allocation).</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Universities in general</span> need to drag out their dirty laundry and ask for external feedback... and then listen to it.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">University leaders</span>, both formal and informal, need to be trained as to how to facilitate transformation and change in their schools.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Industry leaders</span> should be invited to participate in the university change and formation process. They're hiring our graduates, after all.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The general public</span> needs to become better informed about these issues, and speak up on what they think is important.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Faculty and staff</span> should be rewarded within and outside of their disciplines and schools for taking risks and trying new things, even if they don't "succeed." They should also be hired with an eye towards how they can grow the university in the future, not necessarily how well they fit into the "tradition of the now."</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Accreditation agencies</span> should support and facilitate changes within the institutions they certify.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Institutional research offices</span> should be placed in every university. (At Olin, we have the Office of Innovation and Research, which I'd really like to hear more from... who wants to talk to Sherra?)</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The institution's mission </span>needs to be clear, bold, and known by every member of the school's community. (How many of us know the Olin <a href="http://www.olin.edu/about_olin/overview.asp">mission statement</a>?)</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">K-12 education</span> must be supported by universities. We need to help these kids get ready to come to us.</li>
<li>Finally, my favorite: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Teaching and learning must be a primary goal of every institution and be supported at every level and in every unit in both words and action.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Finally,</p>
<blockquote><p>It should also be noted that technology can also be a major force for significant institutional change. In many instances it can have an impact far beyond what its advocates envisioned, impacting the mission, priorities <span style="font-weight: bold;">and the very culture</span> of the college or university. (emphasis mine)</p></blockquote>
<p>I'll probably write more on this topic later, but I'd like to hear what other people think about these issues. Are these criteria true? Are we doing them at Olin?</p>
