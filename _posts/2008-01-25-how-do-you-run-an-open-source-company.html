<p>I love reading the reactions of new XO owners, <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=1206">both</a> <a href="http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7140443.stm">kids</a> and <a href="http://beckersmith.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/01/xo-on-the-go.html">adults </a>(and then there are the <a href="http://echoengineering.com/wordpress/?p=28">hackers</a>, who are kids in adult bodies...)</p>
<p>Well,   the ones that understand that the laptop is still a work in progress by a largely volunteer community of open-source hackers, that they're supposed to figure things out on their own and tinker, and who don't expect it to replace their $2000 corporate laptop running Excel and Powerpoint with 24/7 tech support reporting overseas to a pyramid hierarchy.</p>
<p>I have decided that I do not want a traditional MBA.</p>
<p>I want to learn how to run an open-source company.</p>
<p>(Yes, I'm still studying engineering education - but I'm becoming more and more convinced that entrepreneurship, particularly that of the socially-responsible type, is a mandatory skill for good hackers - since entrepreneurship is the creation of value, and hacking is an <em>excellent</em> way of learning how to cleverly create and explosively leverage that value while having fun in the meantime. It's another tool. You expand your reach.)</p>
<p>This is a larger statement than it might seem - the most common question I was asked while in the Philippines was "so, when are you going to get your MBA?" My father and all my uncles did it; my cousins are starting to head towards the same, and everyone expects my brother to follow (and I guess they figured I would as well). It almost seems like the traditional career/study path of the Chinese-Filipino kid, although I know it's not the only one.</p>
<p>Trouble is, according to my mother, "you can't get a degree in it." (I don't care.) But there's also the problem of how you learn to <em>do</em> it - which makes me a very, very happy Mel. Because in the absence of a formal program of study, guess what?</p>
<p>I get to make my own.</p>
