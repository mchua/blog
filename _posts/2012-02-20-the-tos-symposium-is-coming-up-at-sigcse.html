<p>We're a bit over a week away from the <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/SIGCSE_2012/TOS_symposium">Teaching Open Source symposium</a> (unconference!) at <a href="http://www.sigcse.org/sigcse2012/attendees/registration.php">SIGCSE</a>, which is the largest CS education conference in the world. This year it's in Raleigh,   NC, home of Red Hat (and formerly myself as well - so I'm looking forward to revisiting some old haunts while in town. I miss the BBQ!)</p>
<p>First: I know we have a lot more people coming than <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/SIGCSE_2012/TOS_symposium#Who.27s_coming">the attendee list</a> indicates -- if you're registering, either edit the page to add your name, or <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/contact">email me</a> and I'll add it for you.</p>
<p>Second: the event is going to be unconference-style -- don't worry, we'll explain this at the start the event itself (it's much easier to explain in person). If you want a preview of what you'll be in for, see <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/SIGCSE_2012/TOS_symposium#Resources">the links at the bottom of the event page</a>. The general idea is that in most conferences, the "hallway track" has way more interesting conversations than the "sage on the stage" presentations do -- so why not try to facilitate a lot of hallway-track style interactions?</p>
<p>What this means in practice is that people come in with questions, thoughts, projects, materials, etc, and then we go around the room doing a rapid-fire pitch of our ideas at the start of the day, then take some time to group common interests into session slots (so 3 people interested in sharing various "FOSS for the humanities" ideas might share a session, and 2 people presenting on capstone classes may share a session -- and that is how the schedule's built). Think of a jazz jam session translated into conference format and you'll mostly have it. (FOSS community members: it's interesting to see how different academic conference culture is from what we're used to. Useful culture-bridging moment, to be sure.)</p>
<p>Third: Because it is unconference style, it's good to start thinking about session topics you'd like to see now. Check out the <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/SIGCSE_2012/TOS_symposium#Proposed_Sessions">current ideas</a>Â  and then add your own. FOSS community members -- what would you like to see CS faculty discuss? Here's your chance!</p>
<p>Questions? Holler here. I've also <a href="http://lists.teachingopensource.org/pipermail/tos/2012-February/004843.html">posted this to the TOS mailing list.</a></p>
