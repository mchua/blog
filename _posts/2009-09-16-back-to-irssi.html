<p><i>Dear mom and dad: I apologize in advance for this post probably not making any sense. Basically, there are some programs that I used back in high school that I still like and am going back to use again now. If you (or anyone else) have questions about the stuff I'm talking about here, please ask! A couple of potentially handy links: <a href="http://irssi.org">irssi</a>, <a href="http://xchat.org">XChat</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>, <a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/640">quicktext</a>, <a href="http://mutt.org">mutt</a>, <a href="http://vim.org">vim</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs">emacs</a>.</i></p>
<p>My first IRC client was irssi. I switched to XChat in college when I was helping friends get started with Linux because I wanted to dogfood the applications I was recommending to them, but the lure of always-on-ness with screen and the simplicity of the terminal was too strong; I switched back this week at Karsten's suggestion.</p>
<p>And I've got questions.
<ul>
<li>What plugins do people recommend? (I have none installed at present.)</li>
<li>Is there a way to make your terminal flash a notification in your taskbar (or otherwise somehow notify you visually outside the terminal window itself) when a message directed at you arrives? One of the nicest things about XChat was the flashing icon that would appear when I was working on something else while waiting for a particular urgent ping to interrupt me.</li>
<li>For those of you who use irssi in a terminal running in your window manager and regularly have more than 11 channels open at a time, what do you do about the alt-W through alt-T irssi channel-switching keyboard shortcuts being overridden by GNOME (or whatever) shortcuts for the Tools, etc. drop-down menus? Is there a way to override this, or a better one-shortcut way of getting to channels 12-15?</li>
<li>For those of you who regularly have more than 20 channels open at a time, is there an easier way of getting at channel, say... 31, than going to channel 1 and then ctrl-P(revious)-ing back until you reach it?</li>
<li>It seems like there is a way, based on highlighted messages and funneling them to one window, to capture <i>only </i>the stuff sent to you while you were out, so you can quickly read scrollback. I haven't played enough to figure that out yet.&nbsp;</li>
<li>other irssi best practices (or rather, "handy habits that workforme and that I recommend")?</li>
</ul>
<p>Heh - before you know it, I'm going to be using mutt and vim again instead of Thunderbird and gEdit. (The switch to mutt depends on finding a good way to replace Thunderbird's quicktext plugin, but I suspect there's some way to kludge a vim macro to do the trick; if not, there <i>must</i> be a way in emacs, and I can just learn that.)</p>
