<p><em>From a <a href="http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/iaep/2010-January/009864.html">thread on iaep</a> some of you may have already seen - administrative stuff below. I'm trying to make it as interesting as possible, believe me.<br />
</em><br />
In an attempt to line things up so that we can get efficiently through Friday morning's meeting (and, I hope, nail those Trademark notions through), Walter, Bernie, and I started a <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board/Meeting_Minutes-2010-01-22">meeting prep page.</a></p>
<p>It's got handy-dandy background information references, discussion points, budget proposals with rationale, draft motions to be proposed after discussion points have been worked through, probable follow-up actions for if a motion passes, and the like. There are some missing bits we could use to improve this document so we can really CRUSH THINGS! on Friday.</p>
<ol>
<li>Walter uploaded a quick <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board/Meeting_Minutes-2010-01-22#Finances%20">status update on finances</a> so we don't need to spend a lot of time coming up to speed on the state of things at the beginning of the meeting. Where do our finances stand? Do we need to worry about taxes, etc? Any impending invoices? Who's responsible for keeping track of this, where are they filing things, and when are we regularly checking in on financial matters? That's all set for now. What we need is <strong>a volunteer to step up to continue keeping track of these things for the next 9 months.</strong> We're in need of an interim treasurer until the next election cycle; if you're interested, please inquire on iaep, in a response to this post, or somewhere that will give us the ability to contact you about this. If you know accountants who've been interested in open source but thought they couldn't contribute if they didn't know how to code, here's a good opportunity. *wink*</li>
<li>Are we missing any <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board/Meeting_Minutes-2010-01-22#Discussion_points">discussion points</a> for the trademark issue? Chris has already <a href="http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/iaep/2010-January/009867.html">found a bug</a>, which has resulted in a <a href="http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/iaep/2010-January/009873.html">proposed code commit</a> and a subsequent <a href="http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/iaep/2010-January/009874.html">patch</a>. Help us find more!</li>
</ol>
<p>That's all - thanks for your patience, everyone! Thoughts/comments/patches/flames extremely welcome.</p>
