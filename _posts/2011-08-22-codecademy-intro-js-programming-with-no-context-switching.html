<p>Via my brother <a href="http://www.jchua.com/">Jason</a>, a lovely example of gamification: <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/#%21/exercise/0">codecademy</a> is an interactive javascript tutorial on introductory programming in javascript. It's browser-based and gives you constant bits of feedback, rewards, and a constant helping hand of <em>just</em> the right level towards the right answer; both the code and the pedagogy appear sound. I haven't tried <em>really</em> hammering on the platform to see if, for instance, malicious code could be injected, but it can certainly catch errors from its intended audience of blunder-prone novice coders.</p>
<p>One of the nicest things this site illustrates is how to build learning-supportive feedback directly into the doing of the task itself. It's long been shown that context-switching is a mentally inefficient and disorienting task. This UI layout, with the tutorial content right next to (or in some cases, inside) the code environment itself, prevents you from needing to context-switch at all; compare this to a textbook, where you have to rapidly transition between reading <em>about</em> programming and actually <em>doing</em> programming. Lecture is even worse; not only do you have to context-switch constantly, you have no control over when you context-switch and what content is presented to you at what pace (when the teacher talks about a topic, they talk about that topic <em>right then</em>, regardless of whether or not it's what you need to hear).</p>
<p>I've dropped the makers of codecademy a line to see if we can learn more about what they're using for a backend. I'm curious what sort of tools are out there to support good pedagogical techniques, and how flexible/extensible they are for other applications. It doesn't look like it's open source right now, but we'll find out, I hope.</p>
