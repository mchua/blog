<p>Oh wow. I'm actually able to sleep now after quite some time on the road and without a proper night's rest (1.5 hours is too little even for me). Before I pass out, a few stray bits to write to disk so that I don't forget...
<ol>
<li>unblock <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Insight">Fedora Insight</a> <i>completely</i>. I've done an awful job the past 3 weeks of constantly articulating open tasks and now it's coming back to bite me - I need to start shouting very loudly and doing very rapidly,   though I <i>hate</i> operating in crunch-time mode when I could probably have avoided it. If you're reading this before I wake up and want something to dive in on, <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/marketing-team/query?status=new&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=reopened&amp;component=Fedora+Insight&amp;order=priority">here are the FI tickets</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=528003">here is a package that needs fixing/review</a>, and we need to nail down the "get everything settled on staging" process so that we can pull the lever on production this week. </li>
<li>List out all <a href="http://poelstra.fedorapeople.org/schedules/f-12/f-12-marketing-tasks.html">Fedora Marketing deliverables remaining for F12</a> and figure out completion status, next-actions, blockers remaining to clear, and responsible parties. Start looking ahead to FUDCon, F13, maybe F14 - now that we have the chance to plan ahead, what kinds of things might we begin to think about doing?</li>
<li>Make sure to take some time for myself to settle back and clear my mind and form a solid picture of "community work" in my head - it comes together faster and faster every time I try to conceptualize it, but the pieces still take time to fiddle themselves into place; it's still a new idea I haven't internalized to the point of automation, which is quite nice because it's easier to play with the thought and reconfigure it, but does take some planning ahead.</li>
<li>Similarly, wrap up POSSE in my mind, so I can share that with others.</li>
<li>Remember: the perfect is the enemy of the good.</li>
</ol>
<p>Right now, I'm going to hit the pillow - maybe this time I'll get <i>more</i> than 6 hours of sleep, which would be an unusual triumph. It's been a good day; I'm physically just a bit tired, and the thinking part of my brain is still rattling around at a million miles per hour, but there's definitely another part of my brain (not the thinking part; I'm not sure what to call it) that's just <i>wiped</i>. Ah, sleep is going to be <i>so</i> sweet tonight - I'm usually not tired enough to appreciate this, so this is wonderfully strange for me.</p>
