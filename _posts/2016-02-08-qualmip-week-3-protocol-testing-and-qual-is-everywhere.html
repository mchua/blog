<p><em>Part of the QualMIP series,   <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2016/01/19/qualmip-starting-agreements-fieldwork-focus-grace-weeks-sustainability-and-more/">introduced here</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Part 1: Protocol testing</strong></p>
<p>Today's studio time started with a guest appearance by Elizabeth Doyle, who brought a rough protocol draft for her capstone project. Our mission: split into pairs and stress-test the protocol, trying to misinterpret questions in as many ways as possible. By doing this, we were trying to look at what makes a protocol robust and mature (like last week's "Life Stories" protocol) vs easily thrown off (which we'd expect from <em>any </em>protocol draft -- this is why piloting is so important). Just like code reviews and editing writing are important, testing our qualitative research prototypes is how we iterate and make ethem better.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2: Everything can be a qualitative research project</strong></p>
<p>After a review of what we've learned from our experiences so far and a discussion on future project focus, I stepped back and asked the team: how have they observed me using the techniques we've been playing with inside our studio time itself -- in other words, "if I (Mel) have been treating this engagement as a qualitative research project, what could you say about my study design?"</p>
<p>We discussed my study population and unit of analysis (the three of them, primarily as individuals) and data collection methods (open-ended, opportunistic, blended methodologies; echoing their language a lot, using concrete referents and artifacts to provide commonality) and research question ("how do Olin students experience qualitative fieldwork?") alongside other things.</p>
<p>The point was to make visible that these techniques aren't only for formal engagement, they can be used at <em>any </em>time and in any situation. Just like every movement is a dance even if it's outside a dance studio, every conversation is an interview and every document can be analyzed, and so forth in daily life.</p>
<p><strong>Preparing for next week</strong></p>
<p>Paige, Cesar, and Emily are under instructions to produce at least 100 research questions for their space ("dance meetups") in any Mel-consumable format, with some sort of organization.</p>
<p>Next week, Mel and Brittany will be on a plane to El Paso, so a scavenger hunt exercise in document analysis will be waiting in the office during our normal studio time.</p>
