<p>Let me paint a picture here in words, because I haven't done that in a while.</p>
<p>I'm in my apartment in Raleigh. It's not the best apartment in the world (indeed, it has been described as a "student ghetto" - but the bathroom works now, really!) but it's cheap and it's a place to live and it's got internet and I'm not usually here in any case. I'm in my bedroom with the door open and the AC off, with a half-eaten bag of shrimp chips in front of my keyboard and a pile of dishes to be washed beside me on the desk. A guitar book is open on the floor beside me; on the other side, also on the floor, my keys and wallet and a t-shirt lie in a pile. Housekeeping: not one of my priorities.</p>
<p>I've got a whiteboard (1/3rd of a giant sheet of melamine paneling from Home Depot - less than $11 for 3 big whiteboards!) leaning against the drawers with an October/November schedule and a partial to-do list on it. I've been cranking through that list all day. Then this afternoon I stopped, put on some 70's music, and rummaged around the kitchen throwing things into and out of the fridge while I cranked out some gumbo (on the stove now, waiting for the rice to cook) and started defrosting tofu for a curry I'll make probably this weekend when I finish eating the wok o' gumbo. Until recently, I was sprawled out on the couch with a pot of spaghetti in one arm and a fork in the other hand, and I'm still going back to that pot and shoveling another forkful of spaghetti and tomato sauce into my mouth whenever I realize I'm hungry.</p>
<p>I also munch shrimp chips. Once in a while I leap up and walk to the kitchen and stir the gumbo so the bottom doesn't scorch. In the meantime, I'm booking <i>tons</i> of travel for the fall - Cape Town, Rochester, Arlington, and more.</p>
<p>Ah, gumbo is done. I now have a giant wok o' gumbo sitting on the stove. It's not particularly elegant; frozen gumbo mix, canned tomatoes, rice, broth, seasonings all boiled in a formerly-nonstick wok that now requires oil and constant stirring not to burn things. The gumbo is spicy (of course it is; I cooked it, so I quadrupled the amount of cayenne pepper called for).</p>
<p>Wait, I'm not hungry any more. Put pasta pot in fridge, close chips, drink water (I <i>am</i> dehydrated). Tired, but not sleepy yet; even though I do have a sleep debt I've been catching up with, it's barely 7:30pm and I know I won't be able to sleep if I try to do so now. A giant to-do list stares me in the face, but I don't have the ability to tell what's important on it at the moment. What I need right now is <i>motion</i>. What I need to do right now is unpack the car.</p>
<p>Longer-term: I need to meet people here I can hang out and talk with - more than the few I already know from work. Or... dancing. Yes, dancing. Looks like there's blues on Friday and swing on Saturday and Sunday here; good to know</p>
<p>Aha. I think I have enough of a backtrace on my brain now to know what to do next. Also, I found my cell phone charger! Braindumps... they're sometimes good ideas.</p>
