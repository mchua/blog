<p>Our "Gender/Race/Class in engineering education" class has an "open topic" period that I've volunteered to help design... which means I'm going to Ask The Internet for help. (Hi!)</p>
<p>Based on our class discussion just now, race, class... age? geography? language? disability? intersections of any subset of that? What strategies do we have for doing this dialogue-interrupting work in professional and personal contexts?)</p>
<p>The course will be <strong>Monday, November 18</strong>, which is 2 weeks from now. We're mostly PhD students in engineering education (technical backgrounds, social science research interests, lots of future engineering professors who care deeply about teaching). We have 3 hours in class, plus the ability to ask people to read a reasonable amount (&lt;100 pages, English) before class. I'd love to hear thoughts, especially half-baked ones, on:</p>
<ul>
<li>"learning objective" suggestions -- in other words, what do we want to <em>learn </em>during the course of the 3 hours? (Can be fact-based, skill-based, emotion-based, perspective-expanding-based...)</li>
<li>"assessment" suggestions -- given those learning objectives, how will we tell (at the end of the 3 hours) whether we've learned them, and how well? Does not need to be a test; could be questions for reflection on our own, etc.</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Reading suggestions -- scholarly or not. (For instance, Alice Pawley has offered to let us read her CAREER proposal on feminist engineering -- a short, highly competitive grant for junior scholars whose committee was probably not used to getting "feminist" proposals.)</span></li>
<li>Activity suggestions -- discussions, games to play, short bits of theatre to act out and/or improvise upon, provocative question prompts, etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>Potential inspiration: our guiding question/framing about "interrupting discourse" came from a discussion on "how do we <em>talk </em>to people about this?" and an interest in intersectionality, especially with disability/access. I'm personally curious about the history of opening these dialogues in STEM: who (tenured? white? male? western?) started the conversations about women in physics, minority races in computing, wheelchair-accessible chemistry labs, etc -- and when, and how, and what were the responses?</p>
<p>Comment away! I will post readings (or reading notes, if readings are not freely available), discussion questions/guidelines, and a story of what happened in the class once we run it -- basically, whatever I can do to make the experience we're creating here available and reusable by more people.</p>
