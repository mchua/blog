<p>Oh geez. Geez. Stupid hyperfocus. Dah. Dah. Dah. l'm an idiot for not setting an alarm for stopping work.</p>
<p>It's almost 4:30. I don't know where the last 6 hours went (when I last saw the clock, it was 10:30, and I thought that maybe, <i>maybe</i> it was 1am, right now, before I looked). I have just realize that I am sleepy, hungry, that my right leg has cramped up underneath me, my wrists and my entire right hand minus thumb are sore (yes, I'll stop typing soon) and that I theoretically should wake up in 1.5 hours.</p>
<p>Sure got a lot done, though.</p>
<p>I'm going to bed before I have any further bright ideas about productivity.</p>
