<p>Got this link via <a href="http://imperialwicket.com/new-years-resolution-more-open-source-participation">Nicholas Whittier</a> and thought it was worth sharing, since many of my friends are also Renaissance geeks.The full post is worth reading, but the summary is this:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.sebastianmarshall.com/?p=438">What separates a generalist and a dabbler?</a> <b>Generalists ship.</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Generalists finish things, produce things, have end-points and accomplish them. They may accomplish things in many fields, but they <i>do</i> finish them. </p>
<p>This is a weakness of mine. Oftentimes I trail off after a strong start. It may be worth considering, for me, to have goals based on process rather than specific products - to have my goal be to make products of <i>some sort</i>, and accept that I will ship things across many domains, and that I'll have to explain that to people constantly.</p>
<p>This way, at least, I'll have things to explain them with.</p>
