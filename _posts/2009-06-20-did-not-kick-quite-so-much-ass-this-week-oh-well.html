<p>Oh geez, since I can't actually type more than I already am. Reassessing over OPERATION: WEEKEND!!! - I gotta make sure I can prioritize well before next week when the travel starts to hit.</p>
<p>I am reminded of <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FK4nh5I0jpE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FK4nh5I0jpE</a>, instead.</p>
<p>I'm well aware that the perceived lessened ass-kicking is actually the temporary dip that comes right before you break out of a plateau, so once that spontaneous rewiring happens, things will rock.</p>
<p>Piano results today: I can play over half the major scales now, fluently, at a moderate tempo, with good even fingerings!</p>
