Self-authorship is an adult learning theory developed by Marcia Baxter-Magolda based on studies of college students. It describes a progression from making sense of your life as "something authored by others" to "something I author and negotiate."</p>
<p>Below is a one-page graphic overview of the theory produced for the <a href="https://polytech.purdue.edu/">Purdue Polytechnic Institute</a> (PPI). The document is open-licensed and available online (as you can see), <br />
  so yes -- feel free to share this with your friends however you would like.</p>
