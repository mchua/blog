<p>Planning for <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_2009">POSSE</a> continues, and the excitement mounts (I'm going to be dancing in my plane seat all the way to Raleigh in July). For those who want the gory details, we had a meeting today that <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_2009_Done">got stuff done</a>,&nbsp; and we still have <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_Planning">plenty of stuff left to do.</a></p>
<p>The interesting bits (aside from the curriculum, of course) right now are <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_2009_Planning#VMs">deciding what we want</a> on our "let's play with things and break them!" VM images and thinking of <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_2009_Planning#Logo_ideas">clever logo/slogan designs</a>. If you can think of better ideas, please edit!</p>
<p>I'm sure you folks can think of better catchphrases than "git checkout daschund."[1] (explanation below the fold, since this probably doesn't translate well for non-Americans...)</p>
<p><!--more--><br />[1] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff%27s_posse">POSSE</a>. Westerns, cowboys... <a href="http://www.kididdles.com/lyrics/g035.html">Git along, little dogies</a>. Git a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daschund">long little doggy</a>? I <i>told</i> you you could do better.</p>
