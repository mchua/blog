<p>While reading "Training for Dummies" (for inspiration working on the <a href="http://communityleadershipteam.org/posse">POSSE</a> curriculum), I stumbled across a comparison of pedagogy ("the art and science of teaching children") and <em>andragogy</em> (same thing, but for adult learners).</p>
<p>My first instinct, after reading it, was <em>why would any learner willingly choose pedagogy?</em> I sure don't want to be treated that way. Take a look (table from page 27 of "Training for Dummies" by Elaine Biech):</p>

<p>Well, duh. If I'm treated like an empty bucket dependent on benevolent sources of knowledge to swoop down and fill me and program me like a robot, of course I'm not going to come alive.</p>
<p>Perhaps the reason young people work like adults in open source communities is because that's the way they're treated. Nobody cares if you're 15 or 51; if you're willing to solve a problem they care about, and need to learn something from them in order to do it, they'll teach you. It's easier to be seen as a person and contributor rather than a collection of assorted demographics that say nothing about you as an individual case. Maturity as a self-directed learner is a pervasive expectation; you may initially need coaching to tackle projects fluently on your own, but it's clear that that - not the arbitrary filling-out of grade checkboxes - is your goal. </p>
<p>If we want kids to become mature learners, we need to show them what mature learners look, act, think, and teach like - and expect them to be smart enough to drive their own process of figuring out how to get there, with the help of mentors and coaches along the way. Open source communities make andragogy accessible to anyone with access to a computer and the internet. No questions asked, no admissions applications to fill out - no need to prove you've got <i>potential</i> to learn before you're actually allowed to try your hand at learning it. <i>Don't prove to us that you could learn it</i>, we say. <i>Go learn it, then come back and prove to us you did.</i></p>
<p>That... is my kind of school.</p>
