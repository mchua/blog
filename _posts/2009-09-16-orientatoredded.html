<p>I am officially Oriented. Among other things, this means I've got an "I Am Red Hat" shirt that fits me now, as opposed to the XXL Tunic of Ridiculousness (picture by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ianweller/3764403376">Ian Weller</a>):</p>

<p>Still some getting-started stuff to clear up, like getting my new laptop (Thinkpad x200 yay!) that won't have a dying hard drive and a broken hinge and a cracked screen and... other issues that my beloved but end-of-life x61 has been creaking by with for some time. And figuring out how to get a doctor and put money into my 401(k), because I've been told both are a Very Good Idea.</p>
<p>Happily stuffed with BBQ right now (Greg's wife, who is also named Mel, is an <i>incredible</i> cook) and noodling around with various keyboard arrangements since I can't seem to get to sleep yet. I swore to myself when I graduated from college that I would live my life by waking up every morning and Doing Stuff I Loved. It's one of the consistently toughest decisions that I keep on making, and one of the best decisions that I've ever made. I repeat this over and over like a broken record, but it's true.*</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to a long, long string of mornings like that. I'll be continuing to go to sleep in the mornings Doing Stuff I Love, too. :) It's going to be tough, and I'm going to mess up sometimes, and I'm going to learn a lot, and contribute, and teach, and drink from the firehose, and get pushed, and <i>freakin' love it.</i> I wrote about this before also, but being pushed is still such a rare thing for me that I currently feel like a kid who's been told, at the end of a holiday visit, that their family is moving house to Disneyland.</p>
<p>*making this decision in the beginnings - and there were multiple beginnings (and there still will be - it hasn't stopped), many hesitant ones over an extremely long stream of time during which I often didn't realize I was choosing something, and was confused, and sometimes thought life sucked with no prospect for improving on the horizon, and - look, it wasn't always this clear, and I used to laugh at that cliche, and say "ahahaha, of course it's easy for $name to say that; they're <i>$name</i>." I am not sure how I came to find myself on the flip side of this statement, but it is something I am trying to figure out now. What makes it easy to say - and follow - "do what you love?" Heck, forget "easy" - I'll even take "possible."</p>
<p>When I begin to ramble like this, it's a sure sign I ought to try going to bed again. ;-)</p>
