<p>One of the things I've been starting to do while traveling is take a portable instrument with me. I've got two - a travel acoustic guitar and a travel 5-string fretless electric bass. And I've been teaching myself both. Slowly. From scratch. With no idea what I'm doing.</p>
<p>In the tradition of "release early release often," I submit my first attempts at playing the guitar that resemble a recognizable song. Behold the crappiness! (If you actually like these songs and do not wish to see them butchered, do not play the videos below.)</p>
<p>The first song is "Blackbird," by the Beatles.</p>

<p>And the second is "Diamonds and Rust," by Joan Baez.</p>
<div class="youtube-video"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/NPsLAjCOR7A&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/NPsLAjCOR7A&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div>
<p>I learned both songs by watching the fingers of high school friends playing them, then eventually asking them to do portions of it slowly so I could watch, then hand me the guitar so I could imitate. Not long after this, they taught me to read tab notation. I memorized both songs, and then proceeded to go to college and not borrow a guitar for five years.</p>
<p>Every time I pick up my guitar, I try to get a little better at <em>something</em>. Maybe it's just switching between the F and G7 chords. Maybe it's having a less awkward pull-off in that one section of "Diamonds and Rust." Maybe it won't last into the next practice section, but maybe it will.</p>
<p>Learning is fun. Learning to learn is also fun. I'm context-switching between emails, guitar, and reading gstreamer tutorials tonight - and will continue to do so until interrupted by a trip to Waffle House. Life is good.</p>
