<blockquote>HA! I cleared my inbox today and it's only 4:18am.</p></blockquote>
<p>...from the "you know you need to rewire your priorities when..." book of Mel Quotes</p>
<p>Now to post multiple meeting transcripts, and polish my <a href="http://gurufest.org/">Gurufest</a> talk. Workshop, really. But first, an hour of sleep! Because sleeping is good for you!</p>
<p>Like I said. Priorities. They need to be rewired a bit.</p>
<p>On the up side, today's lipreading workshop seemed to go well, or at least I learned stuff and nobody fell asleep. If there's interest in the comments I'll write up the material in "Mel's Lipreading Crash Course" as a blog post here. And hanging out with teachers tonight == AWESOME.</p>
<p>Have hours ago lost ability to regulate my body temperature. Freezing. Is time for not be conscious. English speak not Yoda when again waking.</p>
