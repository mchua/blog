<p>Sebastian and I spent half the day sprinting on webpages for the 4 new <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Spin_webpage_creation_SOP">there's an SOP for that</a> (still in progress)[0].</p>
<p>As part of this, we present our brilliant new marketing campaign for AWESUMXAUR, formerly known as <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick">Sugar on a Stick</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>AWESUMXAUR, a AWESUM-based AWESUM OF AWESUM featuring the AWESUM Learning Environment and designed to fit on a usb thumbdrive ("AWESUMSTIX"). Originally developed for the One Laptop Per Child Project and designed specifically for K-8 classrooms to engage children in collaborating with others in exploring the world around them, AWESUMXAUR gives students access to a thriving community-created ecosystem of software AWESUMNEZZZ - games and applications designed to achieve specific pedagogical goals (OF AWESUM) - ranging from AWESUM simulators and interactive AWESUM synthesis for beginning readers to a way of accessing and remixing open AWESUM to create and share customized AWESUM of AWESUM.</p></blockquote>
<p>Commented Greg DeKoenigsberg on the rebranding: "I am a big fan."[1][2]</p>
<p>In other news, Sesame Street is awesome. I mean, Jason Mraz singing about going outside with Elmo harmonizing and backup vocals from <i>Muppet birds</i>? This just completely made my day.</p>

<p>[0] The actual spin pages for Soas/Moblin/Design/Security should appear shortly, we still need screenshots/designs/various pieces of content and infrastructure to link to... all before the release in May. It's going to be a fun next couple of weeks.<br />[1] He actually did say this.<br />[2] Yes, I know, I know. I am <i>so</i> tempted to make a parody spin webpage now, but... should wait until the real ones are finished first, and all the other marketing deliverables done, and POSSE set, and... and... and... but!</p>
