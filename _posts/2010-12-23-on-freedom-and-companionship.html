<p>Ongoing thoughts as I sit here in Thailand.</p>
<p>I'll first note that by "freedom" here I mean freedom in many realms, any realm - physical, spiritual, financial, emotional, as it regards families and relationships and friendships, logistics-wise, career-wise... really, anything.</p>
<p>Now:</p>
<p>I want freedom. <i>Need</i> freedom, really, to thrive and be myself.</p>
<p>I want companionship. Fellowship, community, partnership - I do like company, I do like sharing things, I don't want to be lonely.</p>
<p>I want both these things - and I want them together. They're not mutually incompatible, but if and when I <i>must</i> pick, I choose freedom over company; I'd rather be lonely and at liberty - even lonely and hungry <i>yet</i> at liberty - than comfortable and fed among fellows-in-bondage. It's a mistake to equate freedom with solitude, and that's a mistake I've made in the past; you can be free and alone, but it's better yet to be free and together. </p>
<p>I want to be a free person in the company of free people, part of a community where people make their own choices and where they <i>choose to be together</i> - where they are together because they want to be rather than because they have no other option but to be.</p>
<p>If people I care about - family, friends, teammates, anybody - are not at liberty themselves for any reason, I won't abandon them on account of that, if they are trying to get out and join me. I will wait. I will even go back to visit, and to help - but I'm always, <i>always</i> waiting for them to get through and be free themselves. I won't go back and <i>stay</i>; I won't relinquish my own freedom to be with them. And I will trust that those who care for me will understand, or come to understand - I believe that people also want freedom for those they love. </p>
<p>I do. And whatever patience and strength and courage they and I need for that, we will find and make and ask for.</p>
<p>Others have made this choice in many different realms before. Those who've converted to - for instance, Christianity - they still love their family, regardless of how their family reacts to them, because that's what the religion teaches (in fact - and I agree with this - it says that God <i>is</i> love). And because of that love, they hope their family will also convert and join them in the freedom and the richness that they've found in Jesus. They <i>don't</i> go "I love you, so I'll convert back to paganism/atheism/whatever." That isn't love. You love your neighbor, yes - but you also love yourself. You love your neighbor <i>as you love yourself</i>. I have often made the mistake of loving my neighbor more, and myself not at all.</p>
<p>But that does not make sense. If you're wealthy, you don't help a friend out of debt by blowing out your own credit cards; if you're in good physical shape, you don't help a family member lose weight by going on a 5-month forced donut-eating binge so you can journey out together. That's silly. You use your stability and your knowledge to <i>stay</i> there while helping them come out. You give them something to work <i>towards</i>.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that I'm free in all these aspects of my life (and others I've forgotten to list). Far from it. Financially, I'm pretty well-off for a 24-year-old. Career-wise, not bad either. I'm pretty satisfied with my friendships - I have been very blessed - there are probably ways to improve that balance, but I'm quite happy with what I have. </p>
<p>But I also do a terrible job of taking care of myself. Emotionally, family-and-relationships-wise, I'm a wreck. Physically, I'm 24 and lucky enough to be have good health <i>despite</i> the abuse I put my body through, but I know it's "despite" and not "because." I have been trying to readjust my pace, particularly over the past few months, because I know that if I keep this pace up it'll destroy me within the next decade. (RSI was a big wake-up call in this regard.) So there are things I'm far from free in, far from good at, far from clear with. </p>
<p>And the overall balance I have between all this stuff is utter crap - it's like getting an A+ on one class that represents a 200% and F's in all the rest. I could get an A+ with 100% and pull those F's up to D's, at least. Or I could get straight B's, or some A's and some B's and some C's - the balance doesn't matter, I can choose that... but I want a different balance than the one I have now. I would like to not have F's, and if the tradeoff is that I get an A instead of an A+ somewhere else, then... that's what the tradeoff is. A better balance will give me a chance to build my resources and my strengths, so instead of needing to use my A+ to frantically bail out all these F's, maybe I'll have an A and then a lot of C's, but then I can start working on the C's so they'll become B-'s, but from a stance of "this is reasonably acceptable and it will get <i>better now!</i>" rather than "<i>GAAH! FAIL! PANIC!</i>" </p>
<p>So there's stuff I could be better at. And I can and should have my friends who are better at those things than I am help me learn from their example; stay a stable base there themselves, and wait for me and help me join them in that sort of abundance. We all have strengths and weaknesses; that's why we join together so that we can help each other balance out. Pull each other onwards, upwards.</p>
<p>This isn't eloquent nor as coherent as I'd like it to be, but it's out there; I'm posting this out as a chronicle to my future self. Then I will finish writing an email, then I will write some thank-you notes to a few people who've inspired me, then I will... see where I'm at.</p>
<p>This is what I need the time and space to do, this sort of thinking, resting, mind-clearing. I'm going to talk with my family about it when they get back. And I will find some way to have this space <i>and</i> be with them. Maybe I wake up early in the morning, maybe I bow out of some things we do together so that I'll be 100% there during the other ones. We'll see. Whatever it is, I'm going to keep my own stillness and my own peace and my own center <i>so that</i> I can be with others.</p>
<p>Easier said than done, I know. But the hard is what makes it great.</p>
