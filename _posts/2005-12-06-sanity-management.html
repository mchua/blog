<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I am overworked, behind,   and sick. Everything is okay. Everything is okay. I'm taking a deep breath now. I am overworked, behind, and sick, but this will all pass. As a matter of fact, I think I smell an engineering problem. Optimization of self - go, go, go! Project time span: 3 days. By 3pm on Friday the 9th, I will no longer be overworked, behind, and/or sick.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Issue 1: Sick.</span></p>
<p>Fix-it plan:
<ul>
<li>Sleep - at least 5 hours a night, uninterrupted.</li>
<li>Water - At least 96 oz a day. Juice does not count.</li>
<li>Food - Hot food. Good nutrition. No more skipping meals - at least 3 a day. No junk.</li>
<li>Medicine - Purchasing some sort of effervescent cold remedy. Taking religiously.</li>
<li>Warmth - Will wear jacket when outside at all times. Will take hot showers every morning and night to clear sinuses OF DOOM.</li>
<li>Exercise - No running, but study breaks will consist of stretching.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Issue 2: Overworked.</span></p>
<p>Fix-it plan:
<ul>
<li>Company - work in lounges and labs and classrooms with other people as much as possible for sanity's sake.</li>
<li>Breaks - at least one full hour of every day will be devoted to doing something I want, no matter what is due.</li>
<li>Workspace - my desk will be kept clean. No matter how in a hurry I am or how late I will be, I always have time to put whatever it is back in a folder or drawer.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Issue 3: Behind.</p>
<p></span>Fix-it plan:
<ul>
<li>Tuesday evening: Finances, filing, family obligations.</li>
<li>Tuesday night: ECS grading.</li>
<li>Wednesday morning: Comparch reading.</li>
<li>Wednesday afternoon: ODO research.</li>
<li>Wednesday evening: Comparch writing.</li>
<li>Wednesday night: Matsci experiments and analysis.</li>
<li>Thursday morning: HFID coding.</li>
<li>Thursday afternoon: Matsci draft writing.</li>
<li>Thursday night: HFID presentation.</li>
<li>Friday morning: Matsci final writing.</li>
<li>Friday night: Formal dancing. Lord help me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing later:
<ul>
<li>Comparch studying.</li>
<li>Comparch coding.</li>
<li>HFID writing.</li>
<li>HPV compiling.</li>
<li>HPV designing.</li>
<li>Matsci presentation.</li>
<li>Matsci studying.</li>
<li>Career fair publicity.</li>
<li>Expo prep.</li>
<li>Discrete testing.</li>
<li>Personal correspondence.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll post progress updates in the comments. Go, go, go!</p>
