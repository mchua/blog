<p>It occurred to me on the bus from the mall last night - after the Mel Gets A Business Casual Wardrobe adventure - that perhaps clothes are to me what technology is to most people.</p>
<p>I want to be warm, at least marginally socially acceptable, and Not Spend Money. I don't <i>want</i> to update my wardrobe for each new fashion season; I don't even know when those seasons start or end or how that sausage gets made, and I certainly don't want ruffles on my shirts now - or ever - regardless of whether they're in fashion or not. I don't know how to sew, nor do I have the time to make extensive modifications, so I need stuff that works for me straight off the racks. (This last sentence may change; I can't stand having something I don't know how to hack, so acquiring these sorts of skills may be in my future.)</p>
<p>And how is one brand of trousers different from another? And why doesn't everyone use the same sizing system? Really, all I do is get up in the morning, find a clean pair of jeans, grab the t-shirt on the top of the stack, and I don't <i>care</i> about anything else because I want to spend my time on <i>other things</i>. Open source, for instance.</p>
<p>So when I meet someone that's into clothes, I try to listen and understand why they're fascinated with it, while knowing full well that I probably never really will be. And sometimes I learn fascinating things, like how denim has a funny weave that I forget the name of (update: twill!) and it's nice to encounter those little nuggets of interestingness... and that's all.</p>
<p>And if it's okay for me to feel that way about clothes - and I think it is, because I do - then it's got to be okay for other people to feel that way about the stuff I love. And I should make sure that the world I help to build is a world where both these things work out just fine.</p>
