<p>In her maternal zeal, or something to muss it up or otherwise make me look older than 10 (I would use scissors, but that just sounds like a bad idea).</p>
<p>The lack of sunlight is bothering me this year more than I've remembered it doing in the past. I've always gotten peeved at a lack of long days, but now I actually grimace when I look out the windows at 5pm. Is this why people go to grad school in California? Anyways, darkness signals my brain to stop studying and start lazing around with books, which is <span style="font-style: italic;">bad </span>during the end of term crunch. I have projects to finish, darn it. I want my sun.</p>
