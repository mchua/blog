<p>I'm not the only one who's remarked on this recently, but reading the blogs of friends is an excellent remedy for depression. If all the cool people I admire have their moments of despondence and occasionally feel incompetent, then... maybe I'm sort of normal.</p>
<p>I'm still fighting past nontechnical problems in order to be able to solve technical ones. I am no longer bolting for the tissue box every few seconds; instead, I'm hawking phlegm into the sink every few minutes. It's an improvement; at least it's a great incentive for me to constantly chug water. Also, the wireless router is now more frequently on but the quality of the connection is somewhat more finicky (hey, have <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span> ever tried to configure Trac on a remote server when your connection keeps hanging?)</p>
<p>Finally, I have yet to convince people that I'm not actually on vacation and that I have work to do even if I don't go to the office for a regular paycheck. (Also on my list of myths to dispel: being an electrical engineer <span style="font-style: italic;">does not</span> mean I can wire your house or fix your computer. My idea of "fixing your computer" probably involves installing Linux on it.)<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></p>
<p>Ok. My connection seems kind of stable now. Armed with the power of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen">screen</a>, I'm going to try getting Trac up again.</p>
