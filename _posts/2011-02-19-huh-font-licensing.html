<p><em></em>So this afternoon I was making business cards for <a href="http://teachingopensource.org">Teaching Open Source</a> community members to hand out at the big <a href="http://www.sigcse.org/sigcse2011">SIGCSE</a> conference that's coming up.</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="http://blog.melchua.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/tos-businesscard.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>As I went along, I uploaded images and chattered away in our public IRC channel, <strong>#teachingopensource</strong> (freenode), to open up the possibility of drop-by comments and contributions. <em>(<a href="http://theopensourceway.org">TOSW</a> tip: enable other people to pleasantly surprise you, and sometimes they will.) </em>And lo and behold, <a href="http://iquaid.org">Karsten Wade</a> came along - "I would be interested in seeing a version without the 'join us' at the bottom, and the URL-etc. pushed down a bit," said Karsten Wade. "I think it really makes the whole thing more readable to have that whitespace."</p>
<p>And it did.</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="http://blog.melchua.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/tos-businesscard-2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We kept talking, and Karsten asked me to check out his <a href="http://iquaid.org/2011/02/19/banner-mistake-for-the-open-source-way-website/">blog post</a> about a slip-up on font licensing for theopensourceway.org. <em>Shoot</em>, I thought. <em>Didn't think about that. I'm about to tell people they can remix these cards for their own purposes... did I actually use open-licensed fonts for this design?</em> I'd used Droid Sans for the sans-serif font and URW Bookman L for the serif; both were included in <a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a> packages (and I hadn't installed any non-free fonts on my computer), but I wanted to make sure and find out what licenses they actually had.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Fedora design guru <a href="http://mairin.wordpress.com">Mo Duffy</a> keeps a <a href="http://duffy.fedorapeople.org/fonts/">table of font licenses</a> on her website. A quick check, and... phew - I was good. Everything was redistributable. But the Bookman font said it was licensed under the "GPL with Font Exception." What the bloody blazes was a font exception? Looking around led me to an <a href="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/20050425novalis">old blog post</a> by <a href="http://novalis.org/">David Turner</a>, a former colleague of mine from <a href="http://openplans.org">Open Plans</a>, who worked for the <a href="http://fsf.org">FSF</a> before that and wrote about exactly these kinds of issues every day. Between that and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#FontException">a section of the official GPL FAQ</a>, I kinda figured it out.</p>
<p>The normal <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL license</a> says that if you use a GPL-licensed thing as part of something else you make, the entirety of that something-else has to be GPL-licensed as well. This is called <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">copyleft</a>, and it's a simple but powerful idea - basically, infectious freedom. So let's imagine I'm writing a document on my computer - being the FOSS geek I am, this means OpenOffice running on Fedora - and I'm using a GPL'd font, and embed that font into my document because I want to make sure it formats the same way when I send it to someone else, and... wait, <em>hang on there</em>. Does that mean I now have to license <em>every single paper</em> I write that way under the GPL, since I'm using a GPL-licensed font as part of it?</p>
<p>That's where the font exception clause comes in. Essentially, it says that if you're <em>just</em> including that font in a document in order to typeset it, copyleft does not apply;Â  the document itself can be as proprietary as you like. Handy if you need to prepare documents that must legally be private (student grades, etc[0]) but still like open source apps and fonts. I thought this was pretty cool - a random little snip I hadn't expected to learn about, but came across today anyhow.</p>
<p>"I never even thought of that legal scenario," I told Karsten. "Don't worry," he said. "<a href="http://stallman.org/">RMS</a> has."</p>
<p>[0] Thanks to <a href="http://www.math.missouri.edu/personnel/other/aubreyj.html">Jason Aubrey</a> and <a href="https://cs.senecac.on.ca/%7Ectyler/">Chris Tyler</a> for getting me started thinking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FERPA">FERPA</a> again. It's a good reminder that there are legal/privacy issues that professors need to think about when designing courses - what if students don't want their work publicized, or if they don't want others to be able to see their professors' code review comments? Standard release forms might be a nice thing to include as part of the arsenal we're giving <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> professors.</p>
