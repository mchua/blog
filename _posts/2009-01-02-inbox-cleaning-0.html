<p>I did this for two reasons: (1) I promised myself I'd get to Inbox Zero by the start of the New Year (and really, "tomorrow" doesn't start until you've slept,   right?) and (2) I can't shake my adrenaline, but I <em>need</em> to rest, so I'm running the tank until it's empty and I crash (controlled, into a padded wall... in this case, my bed). I'm pretty sure I can convince myself that I am tired now.</p>
<p>*checks* Oh whoa. Yeah. I'm <em>tired</em>. Okay.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
