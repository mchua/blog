<p>Most of my recent posts have been reflective ones; it's interesting to note that, and to wonder when they'll swing in a different direction.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's strange to look back and realize how much your thinking's changed in one semester. It's not a full-blown mind-flip like I've had in the past, but given that grad school wasn't <em>exactly</em> my all-consuming full-time gig this term and that a constant worry was that I was shortchanging myself and "not absorbing anything,  " it's... nice to know I learned a lot. A few recent events pointed this out to me.</p>
<p>The first was when a conversation about <a href="http://www.abet.org/DisplayTemplates/NewsAndPubs.aspx?id=57">ABET accreditation</a> (which certifies colleges as "real engineering schools") came up on an Olin mailing list. My first thought: "This discussion should be grounded in the knowledge of the accreditation criteria and process at least a <em>little</em>." (I directly blame my professors Senay Purzer, Ruth Streveler, Alice Pawley, and Brent Jesiek for infecting my brain with the "this should be grounded" meme.) And so I typed up a quick-n'-dirty guide to ABET background which I'll post here in a moment.</p>
<p>The second was when <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/2107">David Wiley advertised</a> that he and a new grad student were "currently looking for research exploring the motivational and / or learning outcome impacts that occur when student work is made public." I sat down and <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/2107/comment-page-1#comment-49682">wrote out a long braindump</a> in reply (short version: major dearth of empirical work, let's fix this).</p>
<p>Then there was the <a href="http://fie2012.org/general/welcome-fie-2012-0">FIE 2012 call for papers</a>, wherein during a conversation with <a href="http://blog.sdziallas.com">Sebastian</a> about what we should be submitting, I realized that academic venues didn't seem... so unfamiliar to me now. As I told <a href="http://sububi.org">Matt</a> earlier this month while we were sitting around his mother-in-law's kitchen table late at night, it feels like I'm starting to see the way the fabric of this world is put together. I'm not saying I'm <em>good</em> at this. I'm not. I know I'm a stumbling novice. But I can see, most of the time, where I might be blind, and know where and how to ask for help in it; more and more now I can see the mistakes I've made -- and sometimes the ones I'm about to make, so I can correct myself before I make them...</p>
<p>I've been in this state before with every project, every community, I've ever learned to shape as a whole system; Olin, OLPC, Fedora, others... I'm starting to get the same subtle shimmering sensation that tells me that someday - not now, maybe not even soon, but someday - this world will be my world, and I will be able to shape it, bring others into it, and bridge it into other universes. And I say "my world" not in the sense of possession or control that excludes others, but in the sense of fluid and empowered citizenship.</p>
