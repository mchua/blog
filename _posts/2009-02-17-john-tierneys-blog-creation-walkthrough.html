<p>John Tiernery has created a <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/howto-make-a-blog-wordpress.pdf">screenshot walkthrough [pdf]</a> of how to make a blog on wordpress.com. If you've been thinking about joining <a href="http://planet.sugarlabs.org">Planet Sugar Labs</a> but don't yet have a blog, it's a good way to get started.</p>
