<p>I don't make New Year's resolutions - for me, and so I don't make them. (This means I greatly admire people who <i>can</i> make and keep them.) Three things I am continuing to work on, though.</p>
<ol>
<li>Develop my ability to turn that super-turbo-hyperactive button <i>off.</i></li>
<li>Constrain my whining in the form of overthinking things the same way I constrain my whining-like whining. ("I'm going to whine and vent for 5 minutes to get it out of my system, and then I'm going to stop, and then I'm going to <i>do stuff.</i>")</li>
<li>The anti-flakiness campaign - becoming more reliable. Too often I genuinely <i>want</i> my word to be my bond, and then forget. My word should be my bond, period, full stop. Dramatic progress has been made on this in the last 2 months especially, but I still need to strengthen my followup-fu.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yifan, Scott, and the IMSA crew arrive tomorrow; I'm looking forward to them being here in Boston for a week. The "interesting!" and "full of eustress!" life-o-meters are surging and spiking dramatically (yay!) - Yifan, in particular, has been an absolute lifesaver. I'll likely be telling more of this story as the week goes by.</p>
<p>So, today was my only real day of vacation - my day, my schedule, my projects, my extended rest period (I went to bed a bit before 10am and didn't get up until 2pm - for me, that is extended). It was very, very good. Tonight I'll sleep more. Hopefully 6+ hours; I will need the buffer.</p>
<p>The (metaphorical, not actual running) marathon I talked about? It starts tomorrow morning. I'll be running it in a series of sprints, and I'm ready for it to take its toll, with recovery stations on standby along the road. I'm going to be enjoying the journey. I have to; I don't know what the destination's going to be.</p>
<p>Bed.</p>
