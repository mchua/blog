<p>My dad works for a company that distributes medical equipment - things like gauze and medicine cups and tubs to throw up in. The machines for making barf-tubs are actually extremely cool - but then again, I like injection molding machines and manufacturing equipment in general.</p>
<p>They also make gloves. Sometimes their customers do interesting things with them.</p>

<p>Basically, Medline has a line of pink gloves from which a portion of the sales goes towards funding mammograms for underserved populations, St. Vincent Medical Center took the gloves and made a dance video for breast cancer awareness, and the internets have been muchly amused.</p>
<p>It made me smile, so I thought I'd share.</p>
