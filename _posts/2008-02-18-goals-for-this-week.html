<ol>
<li>"Learn <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs."</a> Or at least give it a chance. I've been so long with <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> I've never actually touched other text-editing options other than notepad and more full-featured things like it (gedit, pico, notepad++,   jedit...)</li>
<li>Work through a Spanish textbook 4 days in a row; see how it goes. No further obligation.</li>
<li>Finish a <a href="http://pylonshq.com/">pylons</a> app, any pylons app at all, so I'll be able to test more intelligently around those parts of <a href="http://openplans.org">openplans.</a></li>
<li>Get down to 0 <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Support">support</a> tickets and don't take any new ones for a while; do documentation instead.</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://piklab.sourceforge.net/">piklab</a> and at least <i>order</i> the hardware I need to program.</li>
</ol>
<p>No all-nighters are allowed. Achievable, I think.</p>
