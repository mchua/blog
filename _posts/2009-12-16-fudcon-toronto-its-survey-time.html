<p><em>Also posted to several Fedora mailing lists.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:Toronto_2009">FUDCon Toronto</a> is over - our largest <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon">FUDCon</a> yet! We'd love to get your thoughts on how it went,   so:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you attended FUDCon Toronto, either in-person or remotely via Fedora Live, please take this survey and tell us what you thought.</li>
<li>If you didn't attend FUDCon Toronto but wanted to, please take this survey and tell us how we can help you get to the next one.</li>
<li>If you didn't want to go to FUDCon Toronto, please take this survey and tell us why - it's anonymous. ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://fedoraproject.limequery.org/index.php?sid=34266&amp;lang=en">Take the survey now</a> - it will be open until January 8, 2010.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon_survey">29 questions</a>, most of the yes/no variety; the survey takes less than 5 minutes to complete (I just timed myself). A special thanks to Robyn Bergeron, Yaakov Nemoy, and the rest of the Fedora Marketing team for designing the survey so it <em>can</em> be completed in less than 5 minutes! We'll be analyzing and announcing the results shortly after it closes. If you're curious about the process, interested in helping us analyze the results, or have any questions in general, join the conversation on the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/fedora-marketing-list">Fedora Marketing mailing list.</a></p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://mairin.wordpress.com">Mo</a> tells me that blog posts with pictures get more responses, so...</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Robyn adds: "if you don't recognize the room, but wish you did, or if you heard in a live session that the room was really big but you haven't seen a photo until now... please take the survey!" and she is absolutely correct. Imagine a rotating .gif that flashes between the three and you'll have the right idea.</p>
