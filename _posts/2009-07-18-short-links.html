<p>Things I've read that I'd write more about if I had more time, but toss out to the interwebs instead because I think my friends may find them interesting:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openarchitecturenetwork.org/competitions/challenge/2009">Design the classroom of the future!</a> Well, at this point it's really more <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2009/06/designing_the_c.php">results</a> of such, but the concepts are intriguing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.2020flossroadmap.org/">FLOSS roadmap for 2020</a>. That's Free/Libre Open Source Software, not the item for dental hygiene. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/958">Federal Public Access bill</a> - I wonder how that's working out behind the scenes.</p>
<p>An article titled <a href="http://opencontent.org/future/">"open course wars."</a></p>
<p>And the <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/pamphlet/2009/06/24/206/">education open access policy</a>.</p>
<p>"Open" is <a href="http://openedconference.org/">starting to become a buzzword</a> too, even in education. We need to make sure we keep knowing what this word means.</p>
