<li>Maia has a <a href="http://studentblog.olin.edu/?p=629#comment-70716">good post looking at Olin admissions criteria</a> ("What if Olin admissions had a maximum GPA?") and peeling back the hood on why we might have them.</li>
<li>Sour cream ice cream is actually very, very good, at least when made at Toscanini's. Who knew? It is not a complete dinner, however. (I am going to remedy that now.)</li>
<li>When I am tired, I should go to sleep before I get <i>too</i> silly.</li>
