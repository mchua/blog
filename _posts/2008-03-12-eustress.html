<p>Can you do a backbend? On pointe? On a guy's head? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOqxSaW05p4">At the same time?</a></p>
<p>In other news, give it to a busy person?</p>
<p>I wish I didn't have to run on the edge of panic to get things to happen, though - I seem most effective in the intermittent glitchy periods between overloads, but the overloads are necessary for me to have those intermittent downtimes during which stuff gets done. I wonder if my work habits could learn anything from sports training methodologies (where you overuse your body, then let it rest, then repeat - but do it in a safe and semi-systematic, planned manner).</p>
