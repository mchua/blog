<p>For those wondering where the questions in the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Marketing_research#FUDcon_survey">FUDCon Toronto survey</a> came from, this IRC snippet from #fedora-mktg last month is a little peek from when Robyn (rbergeron) and I (mchua) were going through questions from Yaakov...</p>
<blockquote><p>07:25:09 <strong>&lt; rbergeron&gt;</strong> did fudcon live make it possible for you to participate more or less than otherwise, and how would like to be able to participate and have fudcon live match that.<br />
07:25:22 <strong>&lt; rbergeron&gt; </strong>yaakov said in an email you guys talked a bit about the questions?<br />
07:25:44 <strong>&lt; rbergeron&gt;</strong> do you know offhand what the meaning is in the 2nd half of the sentence there<br />
07:26:14 <strong>&lt; mchua&gt;</strong> rbergeron: yeah, lemme try to parse it better<br />
07:26:39 <strong>&lt; mchua&gt;</strong> for both attendees and remotees and read-notes-afterwards people:<br />
07:26:48 <strong>&lt; mchua&gt;</strong> compare your FUDCon experience with FUDCon Live available<br />
07:27:01 <strong>&lt; mchua&gt;</strong> with your projected FUDCon experience had FUDCon Live not been available<br />
07:27:14 <strong>&lt; mchua&gt;</strong> and let us know the diff, and whether that diff is positive or negative<br />
07:27:40 <strong>&lt; mchua&gt;</strong> now make a third option, "your FUDCon experience with FUDCon Live v.2.0 available"<br />
07:28:10 <strong>&lt; rbergeron&gt;</strong> ahh<br />
07:28:11 <strong>&lt; rbergeron&gt;</strong> ok<br />
07:28:18 <strong>&lt; mchua&gt;</strong> where the value of "FUDCon Live v.2.0" is set such that the third option has the maximum optimal your-happiness-with-your-ability-to-participate value<br />
07:28:23  <strong>* rbergeron</strong> just kind of got a little lost in the 2nd half of the sentence<br />
07:28:37 <strong>&lt; mchua&gt;</strong> and tell us the value of "FUDCon Live v.2.0"<br />
07:28:38  <strong>* rbergeron</strong> laughs<br />
07:29:04 <strong>&lt; mchua&gt;</strong> rbergeron: I'm, um, an engineer sometimes<br />
07:29:25  <strong>* rbergeron</strong> points to mchua's bed ... go sleeeeeep</p></blockquote>
<p>If you haven't taken the survey, please take 5 minutes and <a href="http://fedoraproject.limequery.org/index.php?sid=34266&amp;newtest=Y&amp;lang=en">do so now!</a> It closes in 4 days, on <strong>Friday, January 8, 2010</strong> and will help us <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Events_FAD_2010">improve future FUDCons</a>.</p>
