<p>Months ago, not getting enough sleep or rest, losing track of what I should be focusing on because I was in full-out run-at-panic mode. I was a young and energetic high-pass filter, and had gotten away with that for years because I was <i>so</i> young and energetic that I was used to being able to hit everything I needed to hit by dint of sheer force of will and massive outpouring of effort. I didn't actually <i>need</i> to focus or decide what to focus on. But this strategy was starting to break down.</p>
<p>Greg stopped me and explained the difference between the <i>urgent</i> - what I was responding to as aforementioned young and energetic high-pass filter - and the <i>important</i>, which... I had an occasional vague and shifting idea of, but didn't really think about. Then he told me to read <i>The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</i>. </p>
<p>Now, I actually enjoy books like that. They make me think. But sometimes I feel as if I ought to dismiss them as silly, hand-wavy stuff, mostly because they can be uncomfortable. I'm reading through it now, and actually working through it slowly (as opposed to my usual "entire book! one sitting! go!" info-digest-mode) and one of the things it asks you to do is write a mission statement. I felt <i>really</i> silly. Then I realized that I felt silly because it was uncomfortable, and sat down and actually <i>did</i> it. Awkwardly. Possibly not too well. But I did do it - had it in the back of my head for the past month or so, thought about it occasionally, tried to be quiet and listen - and today I sat down and wrote things out for the first time. It's not perfect, but it's a decent first capture, and now that it's out there, I'll be able to tune it as I go along and learn to listen better.</p>
<p>Anyway. Here's my <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/mission/">personal mission statement</a>, first draft.<br /><em></em></p>
<blockquote><p>I am an interdependent being. I love and care for my family first and<br />
foremost, and my friends, and I allow them to love and care for me. I<br />
acknowledge and believe that I am a wonderful and worthwhile being, and I<br />
trust that others will see that because of the way I choose to live my<br />
life. I trust that those who love me will always be there to catch me. I<br />
am self-reliant, but I am not alone.</p>
<p>I never betray a trust that has been placed in me.</p>
<p>I live in the present. I live with joy and share that joy with those<br />
around me.</p>
<p>I dream wildly and freely, and pursue the dreams I have. I seek to<br />
empower and and assist others in reaching their dreams along the way as I<br />
pursue my own. I prepare myself at all times so that I may be ready to<br />
take opportunities to realize my dreams, and I am awake and aware of<br />
myself and the world around me so that I may recognize those<br />
opportunities when I am blessed with them.</p>
<p>I am thankful and humbled by the graces that have come into my life.</p>
<p>I am a steward of my talents and my resources. I will make sure I<br />
have the physical, financial, mental, emotional, and spiritual means to<br />
care for myself and others. I actively seek opportunities to share what I<br />
have and what I know.</p>
<p>I live with mindfulness and intent.</p>
<p>I strive to clearly communicate my thoughts, feelings, actions, and<br />
goals to others. I default to open, even when nobody else is watching.</p>
<p>I am a learner and a teacher. I lead by teaching, and I teach by<br />
example. The most important thing for me to model to my students is how<br />
to live a good life, rich and full of learning and of love.</p>
<p>I run fast and hard and joyfully, and I stop and breathe when I or<br />
someone I am running with needs it. I do not leave anyone behind.</p>
<p>I take time to reflect and to discern in stillness what it is that I<br />
must do before I do it. I continuously seek and recalibrate against that<br />
which I am called by God to be. I pay attention to the details of the<br />
things that are important. I do not get distracted by the trivial  and<br />
unimportant.</p>
<p>I actively invite feedback and thank others for the lessons they are<br />
teaching me, especially the lessons that are hardest for me to learn. I<br />
seek to listen and to understand before I speak.</p>
<p>I face my fears and difficulties and embrace and thank them as<br />
opportunities for learning and growth.</p>
<p>I am fully aware that it is always my choice, at any given moment, to<br />
do what is right. I am grateful for this freedom and the<br />
responsibilities it places upon me.</p>
<p>I allow myself to feel, hope, and love. Even when it is painful, it<br />
is still worth it to be fully alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm curious whether others have done the same thing, and if so, what yours is, how the process went, and what it has done for you. I'm learning to be a person rather than a hyperactive producer of work deliverables, and I haven't previously articulated the kind of person I want to be, but this is the best I can express it at the moment.</p>
