<p>"So what do you do at <a href="http://olin.edu">Olin</a>?" friends have asked me.<br />
"I research the <a href="http://collaboratory.olin.edu">Collaboratory</a>."<br />
"What's that?"</p>
<p>Good question. Here's the best answer we have now, with the usual caveats that it's a rough draft and our understanding continues to evolve. It's my rendering of ideas originating from Lynn Stein and others.</p>
<p>First of all, it's important to know what the Collaboratory is NOT:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It is not a "center" at Olin,</strong> the way other colleges have centers for teaching and learning, or centers for curriculum development.</li>
<li><strong>It is not a copy machine for making more Olins</strong> in other places -- Olin is Olin, and other schools should be themselves. Engaging with each other helps us become better versions of ourselves.</li>
<li><strong>It is not a shipping dock for exporting Olin to the world.</strong> I myself have described the Collaboratory as "Olin's outreach arm," as if Olin were a separate thing and the Collaboratory was simply a distribution mechanism -- but that's an oversimplified explanation and artificially separates the Collaboratory from Olin.</li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Great, that's what the Collaboratory ISN'T... but then what IS the Collaboratory? This question is harder to answer, but one version is that it's another way to engage with Olin's aspirations.</span></p>
<p>Think of Olin as a building where faculty live, with multiple doors for entry: one is the academic door students walk into. This is the system that we know how to run -- for all our innovation, we are still a college, and we know how to get students into, through, and graduated from our college.</p>
<p>There is another door to the same building. People-who-aren't-students walk through to engage with us -- faculty from other institutions, industry visitors curious about how they can learn from our experiments, thinktanks and government officials, journalists -- people who want to learn from Olin, but who don't study at Olin.</p>
<p>That door is the Collaboratory. It's another way to enter the same Olin. We're still building it, and everyone who walks through that door shapes and reshapes it -- and the building -- with us.</p>
