<p>Tonight was the second time I've ever been on twitter. It was <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/iif/Encouraging_the_Intellectual_Commons">for class</a>. Here are some messages from the ensuing pandemonium.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/RealTimeTrends">RealTimeTrends</a>: <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23iif">#<b>iif</b></a> - is now the <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%239">#9</a> trend on twitter. Follow here: <a href="http://idek.net/2W9">http://idek.net/2W9</a></li>
<p>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/twopular">twopular</a>: <a href="http://twitter.com/mchua">@mchua</a> You are the top trend surfer for '<a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23iif">#<b>iif</b></a>' on twopular right now: <a href="http://twopular.com/trend/_iif">http://twopular.com/trend/_iif</a></li>
<p>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/danray">danray</a>: <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23iif">#<b>iif</b></a> how many meme trackers does Twitter really need? These people should be contributing to debian instead...</li>
<p></ul>
<p>Even better: what happens when a class full of law students <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/iif/Encouraging_the_Intellectual_Commons#Experiment">collaboratively edit the Bill of Rights for 10 minutes</a>? My favorite edits from all 5 editions are merged in the Revised Bill Of Rights, below.</p>
<p><b>Amendment 0</b></p>
<p>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</p>
<p>A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the above.</p>
<p>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the above.</p>
<p><b>Amendment I</b></p>
<p>No law shall violate the right to the free practice and expression of religion, speech, press, and expression. "No law" is here defined as "absolutely no law," rather than "some laws, so long they are not really bad."</p>
<p><b>Amendment II</b></p>
<p>A well regulated food fight, being necessary to the security of a lunch room, the right of the people to keep and bear skittles, shall not be infringed.</p>
<p><b>Amendment III</b></p>
<p>No soldier shall at any time be quartered on foreign soil, the military existing only for self-defense.</p>
<p><b>Amendment IV</b></p>
<p>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, cheezeburgers, lolcats, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures of both their tangible property and information contained electronically therein, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</p>
<p><b>(Amendments V-VII weren't really touched.)</p>
<p>Amendment VIII<br /></b><br />Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments (like death by execution) inflicted. No torture, or any tortured definition of torture that John Yoo, David Addington, or anyone within 6 degrees of separation of them can invent.  Except if it is needed to stop an imminent nuclear attack.  Or if Jack Bauer is involved. </p>
<p><b>Amendment IX</b></p>
<p>The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. These rights also are not limited to those explictly stated in this document but include rights embodied by ideals of justice and liberty and lulz.</p>
<p><b>Amendment X</b></p>
<p>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are preserved in the wiki and reserved to the states respectively, or to the Village People. </p>
<p>Amendment XI</p>
<p>TBA</p>
<p>Man, yall, who killed Amendment XI?</p>
<p><b>Amendment X.2</b></p>
<p>Everyone will have the right to define their own concept of existing, of meaning, of the universe and of the mystery of life.</p>
<p><b>Amendment XII</b></p>
<p>Pi is to be defined as 3 in the state of Indiana.  Worked so well last time.</p>
<p><b>Amendment XIII</b></p>
<p>(was missing.)</p>
<p><b>Amendment XIV</b></p>
<p>"Freeze" commands shall be null and void in the lower 48 states.  You can still freeze in Alaska. Except when playing Simon Says.  Or Freeze tag    </p>
<p><b>Amendment XV</b></p>
<p>Kill all humans, unless you're a robot.</p>
<p><b>Amendment XVI</b></p>
