<p><a href="http://sachachua.com/wp/2006/05/30/networking-with-moleskines/">Sacha</a> uses her notebooks almost exactly like I use mine. One thing she mentioned was finding a way to keep her pen/pencil with the notebook. Here's my favorite solution. Duct and gaffer tape look best.<br /><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="http://blog.melchua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/notebook-penloops.png" /><br />When I have cheap/slim pens with clips, thin notebooks with flexible covers (now: moleskine cahier), and don't mind looking a little scruffy, I use the pen's clip like a paper clip between the page I'm on and whichever cover is nearest. It makes for the fastest notebook opening time ever.</p>
