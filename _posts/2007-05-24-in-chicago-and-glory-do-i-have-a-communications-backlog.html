<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I'm finally back home in Chicago, meaning that I've got a lot of correspondence catching-up to do (how does one accumulate over a thousand emails without noticing?) and I'll be on radio silence for another day or so taking care of that. However, I would like to note that:</p>
<ol>
<li>I failed the Olin challenge twice in the airport - Lynn Stein was on the plane to Paris that was boarding at the gate across from mine, and then I turn around and get on the plane only to discover Joanne Kossuth on the same flight.</li>
<li>My brother is a cynical little man*. And I say this with as much affection as possible. We are very different people indeed.**</li>
<li>Other families give graduation gifts like... I don't know, cameras, or computers, or even cooking equipment. My graduation present... was underwear. "Well, you <i>need</i> to buy it <i>sometime</i>," my mom says. I must admit that it is a rather pragmatic gift, since it's surprisingly expensive stuff and this certainly saves me money. But still. (And she complains that I'm strange!)</li>
</ol>
<p>*A hypothetical scenario is probably the easiest way to describe this. Imagine giving each of us a paperclip.</p>
<p>Me: A paperclip! Oh boy, a <i>paperclip!</i> Thank you, thank you! I'm gonna figure out a million things to do with this paperclip - ooh, maybe I could use it as a jumper wire... or a pin... or - hey, look at this shiny paperclip! You want to go find out about how it was manufactured? Hey, could we teach other people how to use paperclips? Wow, a paperclip! I have a <i>paperclip!</i></p>
<p>Jason: Thank you for the paperclip. How can I get another?</p>
<p>**which is why he's going to Stanford. Something about wanting to study business. Our parents say that we would make a very good partnership (opposites balancing each other out and all that) as long as we don't kill each other first. I told them we got over that back in elementary school when I learned that he could beat me up and he learned that I had a social network (at the time, the network was called "Mommy") that would exact vengeance in my place.</p>
<p>Catching up, thinking, and sleeping a lot. But mostly catching up now. </div>
