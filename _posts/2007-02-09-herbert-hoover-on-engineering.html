<p>President Hoover was an engineer once. I enjoy this <a href="http://users.wpi.edu/%7Emhray/hoover.html">speech</a> of his, particularly the following sentence, which I wholeheartedly agree with (were Hoover my friend today, I'd probably take him up on some of his other points):</p>
<blockquote><p>To the engineer falls the job of clothing the bare bones of science with life, comfort, and hope.</p></blockquote>
<p>Engineers don't just build bridges; they <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> bridges.</p>
