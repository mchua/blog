<p>Advantage of Thanksgiving day: free time, occupied family (cooking), more space and time for me to do the things I've wanted to do since leaving for Singapore.</p>
<p>Disadvantage of Thanksgiving: remembering to use it for the right things (right now, butternut squash soup preparation, <i>not</i> reading through my email/feedreader backlog or gleefully traipsing through Wikipedia articles on things I was interested in). Besides, if I don't start now, the pie will not be baked in time.<br />
If you meet any of the below criteria:
<ol>
<li>Riding the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:FUDCon_Toronto_2009_logistics#People_riding_the_bus">FUDBus</a></li>
<li>In need of crash space in Boston immediately before or after FUDCon (regardless of whether or not you are on the FUDBus)</li>
<li>Can offer crash space in Boston immediately before or after FUDCon (regardless of whether or not you are going to FUDCon)</li>
</ol>
<p>Then you should read <a href="http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/fudcon-planning/2009-November/000354.html">this email</a>, <br />
  which contains bus details and a call for Boston-area couches.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
