<p>All righty, I've got me a <a href="http://elpasotimes.typepad.com/pullen/2010/04/concert-review-update-norah-jones-set-list.html">setlist full of lyrics</a> to learn, and I want to take at least 3 of them and arrange and learn them for fingerstyle guitar[0]. I have 'till August. Norah Jones concert, here I come.</p>
<p>It'll probably be:
<ol>
<li>Don't Know Why (because I have the chords for that painfully worked out already, just need to add the melody and make the fingering less agonizingly awkward)</li>
<li>Sunrise (because I think it's well-suited to a fingerstyle arrangement)</li>
<li>Something Else I Dunno Yet (I <i>guess</i> I could count "Shoot the Moon" here if I actually tab and record my arrangement, though technically it isn't part of the setlist.</li>
</ol>
<p>[0] This is part 1 of 2 of my guitar goals for the summer. The other one is finishing volume 1 of the <a href="http://www.berkleepress.com/catalog/product?product_id=11250">Berklee Method for Guitar</a>. My guitar is traveling the country with me this summer. MUSIC SHALL BE PLAYED!</p>
