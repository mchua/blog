<p>(Written last night.)</p>
<p>It got warmer on Saturday. My immune system was the first thing that noticed. "Hello, you certainly have had a sudden jump in allergens, haven't you?" it went. "I think I'll send all my histamines out to greet you!" it went, as I groggily started diving towards every tissue box within my line of sight. After 3 nights of pumping warm saltwater through my nose (it's called a neti pot), normal respiratory pathways have, by and large, returned. I'm chugging Vitamin C and sleeping as much as my brain will tolerate me sleeping, though. Just in case. I'd hate to get sick now, what with all this impending awesomeness coming up.</p>
<p>Songs with continuous lyrics that spill across rhythmic lines make me very, very happy. For instance:</p>
<p><i>Thoughts meander like a restless<br />wind inside a letterbox they<br />tumble blindly as they make their<br />way across the universe</p>
<p></i>Or:<br /><i><br />I've been fighting but I just feel too<br />tired to be fighting<br />guess I'm not the fighting kind</p>
<p></i>I can sightread tab notation on the guitar now - badly and slowly, but I've gone entire melodic lines now without looking down at my hands. I don't nail it perfectly, but I'm able to figure it out; I'm trying to get a sense of where the fingerboard is in physical space rather than having to eyeball it each time.</p>
<p>Last night I described how-I-work as similar to Tai Chi walking - in that you put your foot fully down, and <i>then</i> shift your weight to it. When you're building something new, something socially constructed, something with other people (a community, I suppose - but I'm trying to avoid the mental habits that word tends to trigger for me) - you're stepping out over a dark chasm. And what you do is plant one foot on the ground where you <i>do</i> stand, and then stretch the other foot out over the void - and place it where the next step ought to be, but <i>put no weight on it</i>. </p>
<p>But it's clear that there must be a step there for you to go forward, so the makings of that step begin to coalesce under your foot, and as they do, you <i>then </i>begin to shift over your weight until you're standing on a new and solid step, and your rear leg is empty - that is to say, bearing no weight - and then you bring <i>that</i> forward over the chasm, and the next step begins to coalesce underneath <i>it</i>, and then...</p>
<p>The "Innovator's &lt;noun&gt;" that Clayton Christiansen writes about in all his books? That's Tai Chi walking. Foot out, foot down, <i>then</i> the weight shift. Foot out, foot down, shift. Foot out, foot down, shift. I oversimplify, and I also don't do Tai Chi walking all that well, but as far as I can tell, they're the same thing. Just... one has feet, and one has technologies. Or educational paradigms. Or companies. Whatever the analogy becomes.</p>
<p>Tonight I am going to be a bad panda and leave my temporary desk up overnight.</p>
