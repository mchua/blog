<p>The feeling of needing to <i>rise</i> to meet expectations is still a foreign one to me, and then having to stand on a chair and use my fist (and perhaps a mop handle) to <i>smash</i> above expectations anyway.</p>
<p>I can count the times I've been <i>really</i> pushed on one hand. Number theory my senior year of high school. A few classes and projects at Olin. Running the community test group at OLPC.</p>
<p>AND THEN THIS ENTIRE FREAKIN' SUMMER.</p>
<p>I'm not used to being asked to step into larger shoes than I'd already planned myself - not used to having to run <i>faster</i> than I'd already planned on pushing in order to keep up with people far smarter and faster than I am - not used to having roles to grow into instead of things to prove I've grown out of.</p>
<p>I like it. I really, <i>really</i> like it. It's wonderful to be able to struggle to grow into something I'm expected to become. Hungry for more.</p>
