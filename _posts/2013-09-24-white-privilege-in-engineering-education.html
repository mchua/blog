<p>Inspired by Peggy McIntosh's <a href="http://www.amptoons.com/blog/files/mcintosh.html">Invisible Knapsack</a>, here are some ways white privilege appears in engineering education:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">If I talk about or study "diversity topics" in engineering, I'm seen as open-minded rather than self-serving. ("Not everything I do will be seen as 'about [my race].')</span></li>
<li>Nobody will assume I got into my program because of affirmative action.</li>
<li>The people who grade my assignments, develop my curricula, and decide whether I graduate or not will probably be of my race.</li>
<li>I will probably not be asked to represent the "perspective of my race" in classroom discussions or design meetings.</li>
<li>I can flub a question, fail a test, or even drop out of a class/major without having it negatively reflect on my entire race.</li>
<li>People are likely to assume I chose engineering as a field out of personal interest (not family pressures, financial reasons, etc.)</li>
<li>I will not get surprised looks when I tell someone I'm an engineer.</li>
<li>People I meet will assume I had a fairly happy, comfortable childhood.</li>
<li>Clients for my service learning projects will probably not look like me.</li>
<li>I can join a study group of non-minority students without being perceived as a "sellout" by members of my race.</li>
<li>When other students are choosing who to study with, I will not be assumed to be "overly studious" (Asian) or "a stupid slacker" (Black/Latino) by default.</li>
<li>I will be assigned to talk with suppliers/clients based on interest rather than nationality ("oh, of course you'll talk with all the Chinese suppliers.")</li>
<li>People will not automatically assume I'm an international student. When I name my hometown, they will accept my answer rather than asking "no, where are you <em>really </em> from?"</li>
<li>I will not be asked to spend my limited free time volunteering for [Minority]-in-Engineering programs.</li>
<li>The professor wouldn't be able to easily tell when I was absent from class.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a partially-remembered remix from a much longer list our class generated on Monday. My brainstorming group was (randomly) entirely composed of non-white women, which was an experience of its own -- many of our items fit the format of "if I were white, people wouldn't [do this negative thing they do to people of my minority group]." I personally struggled to think of anything that <em>wasn't </em>in that format -- white privilege, as opposed to non-white non-privilege that I then flipped into white privilege.</p>
<p>Another group entirely composed of white women was hard-pressed to think of white privilege, so they took male privilege (or rather, female non-privilege) and then tried to extend it to race -- an interesting manifestation of intersectionality, that. It was like trying to see water while swimming; we could barely do it, and even if the words were written on the whiteboard in front of us, we kept forgetting them.</p>
<p>1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, and 14 are mine, by the way. (I can't claim uniqueness. Many of these were also independently brainstormed by others.)</p>
<p>It was only during the course of this discussion that I realized I was the only Asian in the class. We have two men (and a lot more women -- interesting, that I know exactly how many men there are but not women -- see #15), and perhaps a 50/50 breakdown between white women and nonwhite women, some American-born, some international. The race most of us would call "black" is disproportionately represented.</p>
<p>As I wrote that last paragraph, it felt vaguely <em>wrong </em>to categorize my classmates so clinically; these are all living, breathing people I appreciate and respect and am becoming increasingly close to. They're so much more than "white American-born woman" -- that phrasing stamps a clinical factuality of "truthiness" on their identity, an "oh they must be <em>that </em>way" association that I want to outright reject here. We so often describe people as "he/she is [category], <em>but </em>they're [adjective]" -- for instance, "she's Asian, but she's super-chill, she's not one of those that studies all the time." It's almost like you start with an "Asian" template and then add/subtract customizations from that in order to get a person (like a Mel).</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">She's female, but she likes martial arts and math and working on machines. (Implication: most people in the "female" category don't.)</span></li>
<li>She's Asian, but she doesn't speak Chinese, and she often takes initiative without asking for permission. (Implication: that's <em>weird </em>for an Asian person!)</li>
<li>She's deaf, but she talks and lipreads and plays music and you can barely tell. (I can see why this surprises people, but the surprise does get old after a while.)</li>
</ul>
<p>These template people walking around in our heads -- the woman, the Asian -- where do they come from?</p>
<p>Anyway. Generating that list made me realize I was the only Asian, because I'd see things others were writing on the board, and my brain would go:</p>
<blockquote><p>BRAIN: [reading out loud from the board] People will not assume I'm bad at math because of my race.<br />
MEL: But... people don't assume I'm bad at math because of my race.<br />
BRAIN: You don't have this problem! So you have white privilege!<br />
MEL: No, no, it's the opposite problem -- people assume I'm <em>good </em>at math because...<br />
BRAIN: You're Asian!<br />
MEL: oh wait YES THAT'S RIGHT I had forgotten that.</p></blockquote>
<p>It reminded me of how I often don't realize I'm the only woman in a room. Since I can't see myself, and I'm used to seeing white men around me, my subconscious goes "that's right, we're all white guys here, just like we are every day in Engineering-Land!" Until another woman/minority/etc walks into the room, that is.</p>
<blockquote><p>BRAIN: Hey look, a <i>woman </i>in the room!<br />
BRAIN: That's so weird!<br />
BRAIN: Waaaait.<br />
MEL: Um, I'm female.<br />
BRAIN: Now I feel weird being here. Oh man. Do I have to associate with her? Do I need to be her "girl buddy" now? Am I supposed to... argh, what do I do? Maybe the guys are also noticing I'm a girl! GAH! GAAHHH!<br />
MEL: I... I wanted to do work? Can we focus on the work?<br />
BRAIN: GAAAAAAAAAH!</p></blockquote>
<p>It's distracting. I learned long ago to ignore it. Alas, this also meant I learned long ago to automatically ignore race, gender, etc. -- which perpetuates any issues instead of addressing them. But it takes so much energy, this not-ignoring! Why should I be the one expending that energy? (Why can't Other People Fix Everything? Boy, that'd be nice.)</p>
