<p><b>Are you a Fedora contributor? Are you starting college in the fall of 2010, but thanks to <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Heffer">Felix Kaechele</a>, recent secondary school graduates currently finishing their gap/military/service years <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Scholarship_administration_SOP#Students_from_conscription_countries_not_eligible">are now <i>also eligible to apply!</i></a>)</p>
<p>If so, you should apply (or tell them to apply) for the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Scholarship#How_to_apply">Fedora Scholarship.</a> The Fedora Scholarship program recognizes one high school senior per year for contributions to the Fedora Project and free software/content in general, which gives you $2,000 USD plus an automatic full travel/housing sponsorship to attend the FUDCon closest to you for each of the 4 years of your college or university education.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Scholarship#How_to_apply">application process</a> is entirely online, and basically involves you sending us an email with a single attachment. That's it. It's not that bad, really. I mean, you're probably in the middle of college applications now - trust me, compared to those, this application is a <i>breeze</i>. You should <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Scholarship_terms">read the legal jargon here</a> to check all the fine print before you start, but once you start, it mostly boils down to:
<ol>
<li>Tell us who you are and why you should get the scholarship.</li>
<li>Okay, now do it again in resume format.</li>
<li>Great. Now tell us the names of a couple folks in Fedora that you've worked with so we can get some comments from them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Seriously, that's it. The <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Scholarship#Timeline">deadline</a> is <b>February 19, 2010</b>. Go spread the word, and get those applications in!</p>
