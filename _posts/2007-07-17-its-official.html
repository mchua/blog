<p>Apparently, as I have a <a href="http://robogeek.livejournal.com/46549.html">house </a>and a <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Mchua#Who_are_you">job </a>as of this moment - both occurred within the last 12 hours.</p>
<p>The great thing is that I'm not actually going to change the things I'm doing or <span style="font-style: italic;">anything</span> at all. It's just that I have a place to dump my stuff come January, and that my bank account will look a little less malnourished shortly.</p>
<p>Mmm!</p>
