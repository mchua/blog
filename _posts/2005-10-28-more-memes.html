<p>10 years ago . . .<br />- Cried because the first English paper I really let myself write was so different from everyone else's. (This is the paper that gave me the pseudonym "Mouse.")<br />- Had never heard of abstract math before; I thought calculus was just a more complicated form of multiplication that was Really Hard for grownups and that I shouldn't even dream of tackling it yet.<br />- Started piano lessons with Mrs. Budilovsky,   who taught me over the next five years what it really means to play music.<br />- Took home the maximum number of books allowed from the school library every day and read them all after dinner every night instead of going over to friends' houses most of the time.<br />- Didn't hang out with the girls much at recess. I played football, wall-ball, and chicken (wrestle your opponent off the monkey bars while hanging from them yourself) with the boys instead.</p>
<p>5 years ago . . .<br />- Improvised in front of a stage of people for the first time at Pseudo.<br />- Played the cello every day in orchestra; had stopped playing piano, and was too afraid to sing.<br />- Carried a sketchbook in my backpack continuously and drew in it every spare moment. Became known as "The Kid Who Does Art."<br />- Taught for the first time. Fell in love with teaching.<br />- Was (at 14) the "kid sister" to all my IMSA friends, who formed a somewhat protective (if eccentric) family.</p>
<p>1 year ago . . .<br />- Slept in a cave behind Kristen's desk.<br />- Worked all night most nights in the 4N nook grading ICB papers, doing homework, and arguing with Alex and Mark.<br />- Wrote my first a capella arrangement.<br />- Decided to become an ECE by using the Dartboard Method of major-picking. (Seriously.)<br />-</p>
<p>Yesterday I . . .<br />- Slept through my morning classes for the last time this illness<br />- Went to the first two user interviews for the human-powered vehicles team<br />- Started work with Team CHASM on a sustainable grocery bags competition (BetterBags)<br />- Found that kielbasa and cornbread are a great lunch combo<br />- Was only supposed to be in more than one place simulatenously twice</p>
