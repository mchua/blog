<p>I've been asked how to succeed in engineering as a disabled person. This answer -- which is sarcasm,   by the way -- came out during a recent long drive to Kentucky. It's intended to be spoken-word poetry, and was inspired by an intersectionality conversation last month with Joi-Lynn Mondisa.</p>
<p>(Also, I want to point out that I had wonderful friends in engineering undergrad and grad school; I also wish I could have been in a state of less exhaustion and been able to better appreciate those friendships at that time.)</p>
<p><strong>How to succeed in engineering as a disabled person</strong></p>
<p>Work hard.<br />
If something comes up, don't get frustrated.<br />
Be proactive.<br />
Work the system.</p>
<p>Don't get angry.<br />
Don't have feelings.<br />
Don't realize how tired you are.<br />
Don't realize that what you're doing is extra labor.<br />
Stay oblivious. Focus on your classwork.</p>
<p>Don't ask for help.<br />
Don't look dumb.<br />
And never show signs that you're struggling.<br />
That any of this is any harder for you.<br />
That any of this ever hard for you.</p>
<p>Don't socialize.<br />
Don't have friends.<br />
Especially disabled friends. You might start comparing notes.<br />
Besides, you're too tired to hang out with them anyway.</p>
<p>Don't try to find out what you don't know.<br />
There are a lot of things you don't know that you don't know.<br />
That's good. Keep it that way. That'll let you keep working yourself to death.</p>
<p>Oh, and stay away from disability-related things.<br />
Accessibility initiatives. Activism.<br />
They might mess up that delicate balance of ignorance you've worked so hard to build.<br />
You might get mad at how unfair it is.<br />
Or how much life is stacked against you.<br />
Or how much you have to fight.<br />
And how little anybody recognizes it.<br />
And that would be distracting from your work.</p>
<p>And besides, you don't need any of that help, do you?<br />
That's just for people who aren't good enough to make it on their own.<br />
But you?<br />
You're good enough to do it, right?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>You gotta prove that, you know.<br />
You gotta prove you're worth it.<br />
Show you're functional. Always. Constantly.</p>
<p>So don't think too hard about it.<br />
Just work. That's what you're worth as a human.<br />
Work hard.</p>
<p>And that's how you succeed in engineering as a disabled person.</p>
