<p>Calling all bloggers: <a href="http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimania 2006</a> is looking for your take on the upcoming 2nd annual international conference on all things wiki. (try saying that ten times fast!)</p>
<p>You can blog before the conference (August 4-6 at Harvard University), during the conference,   or after. You can blog at the conference or from a distance (the conference will have a lively virtual presence, and the physical sessions will be transcribed, IRC'd, podcasted, and what-have-you). You can blog a short paragraph, write a long article, videocast, podcast, photoblog, scan napkin scribbles, or do interpretative dance. <span style="font-weight: bold;">What we're looking for is</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">wikimania as seen through the eyes of as many people as possible, archived for posterity.</span> You can blog about the conference as a whole, or <a href="wikimania2006.wikimedia.org/wiki/Schedule">individual sessions</a>. You can blog about open-source, education, politics, technology, journalism, or anything else that strikes your fancy. This is about how you see things; your take on Wikimania, your voice.</p>
<p>If you're interested, hop over to <a href="http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikimaniaBlogs">http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikimaniaBlogs</a> and see what's going on. Tell your friends - spread this around the blogosphere. We want as many diverse voices as possible, whether you've barely heard of wikis before or have been developing them for the past 5 years.</p>
