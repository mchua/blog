<p>I do <a href="http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1276">this</a> sometimes. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.olpcnews.com/sales_talk/g1g1_2008/give_a_velociraptor_get_a_velociraptor.html">news</a> is a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081115-the-week-in-hardware-shanghai-amd-and-lcd-price-fixing.html">funny thing</a> (scroll to the bottom of that last link).</p>
<p>Also,   I want to learn a language <a href="http://naglenaglenagle.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-own-experiences-learning-part-1.html">the way Nagle learned German</a>. Mandarin, Japanese, Tagalog, ASL, Fookien (which I know varying amounts of) - and then Spanish, French, Italian, and German (which I do not know at all). Korean, Russian, and Portuguese I wouldn't mind, but have no reason to learn right now. It strikes me that this might be good to do in conjunction with an extended sailing, hiking, biking, or backpacking trip involving a different continent.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem all that unreachable, really. I know people who've done this... not all those languages, but some; not all those modes of travel, but at least one. I can do some of them as well. Standing on the bow of a ship with dolphins leaping beside you - this is something I could also see.</p>
<p>Not that my current life isn't exciting. </p>
<p>Tonight post-hackathon I found myself running after Ryan and Tomeu as they pulled 50 laptops in flimsy cardboard boxes on a rattling cart across cobblestoned Cambridge streets (after Michael and Mitchell had persuaded the attendant to let us out of the garage a good half-hour after it'd closed). A few yards from the door of OLPC's office building, the box ripped and sent XOs spilling onto the street; Mitchell and Greg and I rushed forward and ran alongside the cart, grabbing the cardboard sheets together so that they <i>stayed</i> a box, 6 hackers glommed around a moving cart like some sort of crazy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_dance">dragon dance</a>. By the time we got the laptops back into the office, we were all laughing and out of breath.</p>
<p>"I kinda wish I had a picture of that," I said in the elevator on the way down.</p>
<p>"Actually," said Ryan, "I took a video."</p>
