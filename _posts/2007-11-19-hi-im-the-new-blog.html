<p>If you're coming from <a href="http://mellory.blogspot.com">http://mellory.blogspot.com</a>, you're in the right place. This is the new [M]etabrain [E]ntry [L]og. It's the old blog under different software on a different server at the moment, but housecleaning will commence when I get <a href="http://myrtlewoodgallery.com/get_a_round_tuit.htm">a round tuit</a>. Welcome!</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you've got a feedreader and want to subscribe to this stream-of-consciousness ramble for whatever reason, here's a <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/feed/atom/">link to the atom feed.</a></p>
<p>My main impressions of Shanghai thus far can be summed as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shanghai looks like someone opened a packet of Instant City and Just Added Water. I did not know it was possible to construct so many buildings in so short a time.</li>
<li>Hot chicken soup - especially with mishua (noodles) and goji berries - (we've put those in soup <em>way</em> before they became fashionably antioxidant-riffic) is amazing.</li>
<li>My aunt has an extraordinary number of free hotel slippers in her closet. It's about 10 cubic feet of solid slipper-mass, roughly enough to shod a small rural village.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, it's rather annoying not to be able to freely access wikimedia resources, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikiversity.org">Wikiversity</a> in particular. Oh, to be utterly technologically spoiled again... although the soy milk here is <em>fantastic</em>, so I can't complain all that much.</p>
