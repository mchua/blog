<p>After many weeks of seeing a (supposedly "volunteer technical support") queue swamped with depressing-to-read letters from frustrated donors who haven't gotten their laptop yet, this is a blessed sight for sore eyes.</p>

<p>For those of you who haven't used RT, this is the equivalent of having nothing -<em> nothing</em> - on your to-do list floating around in a state of not-getting-done'dness. IT FEELS GOOD.</p>
<p>Thanks to alc, who (I hear) heroically went through the multi-screen queue we had backpiled. My hat is off to you, sir.</p>
<p>Now it's my turn to categorize volunteers into the type of their offer of help. We have... nearly 900 queries we haven't responded to yet because everyone's just been so dang busy. It will be... fun.</p>
