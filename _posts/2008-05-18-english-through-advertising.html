<p>Now <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/greatestcopyshot">this</a> is cool: Nick Padmore statistically dissects corporate slogans, teaching you about some entertaining linguistic tricks along the way. Ok, most of the rhetorical devices will be familiar to any American or British kid who finished the 7th grade, but I'd sure rather have learned about polysemy from articles like this than from the umpteenth chapter of a dull textbook. It's also an equally lovely lead-in to Markov analysis or literary devices.</p>
