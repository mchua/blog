<p>"I have a surprise for you," my Ama, my father's mother, told me. "Very special surprise."<br />I nodded.<br />"I brought you some <i>tuna fish!</i>"<br />I blinked. "Er... thank you. Tuna fish?"<br />"<i>Special</i> tuna fish. From Henry Sy."[0]<br />"Why... do you have Henry Sy's tuna fish?"<br />"It is very special. They make it just for him. And we are good friends, so he gave some to me. And I bring it to the States. I give a can for Jason, a can for Michael, a can for Mark, and one for you." She pulled out a blue can and presented it to me with great pride. "See? Specially prepared for Henry Sy Sr. and Family."</p>

<p>I read the can, still puzzled. "'The true choice of gourmets.' Do they do anything special to the tuna fish? I mean, is it..."<br />"This is <i>premium</i> tuna fish. Made from <i>prime cuts</i>." My grandmother points to the can's label, which does indeed say "<i>...made from the prime cuts of rare young Yellowfin Tuna. Delicate, smooth and tasty..."</i> I have a sudden urge to grab a pen and add the missing comma.<br />"What do I do with it?"<br />My grandmother laughed, as if this were the most obvious thing in the world. "You <i>eat</i> it!"</p>
<p>Well, okay. That <i>was</i> obvious.</p>
<p>I brought the can to Boston with me and recounted the story to my aunt Lynne May. Then I cooked some spaghetti and poured the oil-packed fish over it; it was packed as an actual whole filet (not ragged clumps), beautifully cooked, perfectly seasoned. The fish flaked beautifully over the pasta, and the oil was subtly spiced. It was a perfect dinner.</p>
<p>I didn't feel right just recycling the can, so I photographed it in commemoration first. (And then I recycled it.) Thank you, Ama.</p>

<p>[0] Henry Sy is a Chinese-Filipino tycoon who owns the mega-mall brand SM (Shoe Mart, which is what they originally sold). I guess the American equivalent would be something like "I have Sam Walton's tuna fish!" and your grandmother being friends with the fellow who founded Wal-Mart, or... yeah. Honestly, I'm also a bit confused.</p>
