<p>It's late. I really need to go to bed. But I want to write about non-RAT things for a moment.</p>
<p>Other work continues. I did everything for my Stats class that's due before next Tuesday (we're really not getting very far on RHIPE, and prepped so that I could write my Design paper <em>and</em> my Hearing Aids lab completely, start-to-finish, tomorrow. Did I mention that both my dances have tech rehearsal tomorrow night? That's why tomorrow's setup for both RAT and non-RAT stuff was so important; I'm going to be doing so much stuff that it's got to be planned, because I'll need to put all my energy in doing and not in deciding what to do.</p>
<p>The fall day was beautifully warm.</p>
<p>I danced tonight for nearly two hours; about an hour of rehearsal with Lily and Kyler for "Control Variable," and then another hour just improvising with Kyler until I was panting hard and dripping sweat onto the Marley. My shoulders needed to shake out after so long on the keyboard. And then I went back, threw some apple cider and an orange and strawberries and a banana into the blender, drank most of a blenderful of smoothie while typing notes (RAT stuff, you'll see it tomorrow) and listening to Jason Mraz and Sara Bareilles and holy crap I'm tired.</p>
<p>Sustainability, right? Right. I check my phone and see that Sebastian has been texting me asking if I'm sleeping for a while. I think that... yes, I will be, because it's quarter to 2am and I've got a 7:30 class.</p>
