<p>Following up on Eric's post on <a href="http://fedora-sparks.blogspot.com/2009/12/limesurvey-little-help-please.html">limesurvey packaging help</a> (we also need it for <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Zikula">zikula</a>)...</p>
<p>If you'd like to help, don't know how to package, but want to learn, there are a bunch of us in the same or close-to-the-same situation (<a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2009/12/07/zikula-hackfest/#comments">me</a>, <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2009/12/07/zikula-hackfest/#comment-3812">Karsten</a>, <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2009/12/07/zikula-hackfest/#comment-3820">Matthew Daniels</a>, <a href="http://iwrotecode.blogspot.com/2009/12/future-fudcon-hackfest-request.html">Aaron Clark</a>, etc...) trying to get a Learn To Package! week together - join us in <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Classroom">Fedora Classroom </a> if you're interested; we're discussing it on the <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/classroom">mailing list</a> now, and <a href="http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/classroom/2009-December/000103.html">here's the thread.</a></p>

<p>Now, a week of learning-how-to-package stuff won't make experienced packagers just like that. And to be completely honest, this might not help us out tremendously <i>right now</i>. But we will need to fine-tune, tweak, revise, and launch v.2.0 of all these sites at <i>some</i> point in the future, and capacity-building for that day is a Very Good Idea. Plus there's always more packaging to be done.</p>
<p>Also - if you <i>can</i> package and want to teach others how to package so we can tackle this stuff so you don't have to, please please please <i>please</i> join the Classroom list discussion and let us know.</p>
