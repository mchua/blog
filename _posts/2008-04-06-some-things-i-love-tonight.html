<p>Black t-shirts,   yawning, and rice porridge ("lugaw") with preserved egg. Working "in the zone" and looking up and going "wait, wait - time has passed?"</p>
<p>Hot, hot showers. I feel bad for taking long* ones. But they feel <em>so good</em> and make my arms and shoulders untwist and feel less knotty. (Hm - "get backrubs, conserve water?" Perhaps I need to start some sort of backrub-swap circle thing here.)</p>
<p>*&gt;5min</p>
<p>Woo! 4 hours of sleep tonight, assuming I go upstairs to bed <em>right now</em>. I'm doing pretty well! (Yes, Andrew, I'll do even better with the getting-sleep thing next month. Promise.)</p>
