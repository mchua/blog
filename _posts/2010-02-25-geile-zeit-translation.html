<p>A quick one done for my bandmates, because they stared at me blankly when I played the song in German. Many liberties have been taken with this translation in order to keep the rhyme and verse structure (thanks to Ginneh for showing me how to figure out what it was, and for doing half the chorus) and there are definitely awkward bits that don't <i>quite</i> work, but it is at least marginally acceptable for a band of native English speakers to be able to sing and play.</p>
<p>This is probably best read after taking a look at the <a href="http://lyricstranslate.com/en/geile-zeit-great-time.html">original lyrics with direct translation</a>, and then <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMT8MDaxqo">listening to the music while reading.</a> Also, as usual, patches welcome. When I needed to pick between the literal translation, making lyrics non-awkward to sing, and capturing the general feeling of the song, I went for non-awkwardness first, feeling second, and literal translation last, which explains the lines like "The road went by so fast" or "I'm sure that you'll be fine," which are totally not in the original song.</p>
<p><b>Good Times - Juli<br /></b><br />Did you believe, did you have hope<br />That I would call your name<br />I hear you cry, I hear you pray<br />That things could be the same<br />Where is the time, where is the sea<br />It's gone<br />It's gone now, you ask me<br />Why can't we keep the flame</p>
<p>The nights have come, the days go by<br />the landscape twists and turns<br />You walk on fragments of the sky<br />don't seem to feel the burn<br />Where is the light, where is your star<br />It's gone<br />It's gone now, you ask me<br />When will you ever learn</p>
<p>The world is changing<br />Everything's changing<br />It all is changing</p>
<p>Good times pass, this wasn't meant to last<br />The road went by so fast<br />remember</p>
<p>Yours and mine, it was an awesome time<br />I'm sure that you'll be fine<br />I'm moving on</p>
<p>I'm moving on<br />I'm moving on</p>
<p>You want to leave, you want to go<br />you want me back again<br />We're breathing in, we're breathing out<br />and nothing's different then<br />Where is the night, where is the way<br />How far<br />How far now, you ask me<br />have we gone hand in hand</p>
<p>The world is changing<br />Everything's changing<br />It all is changing</p>
<p>Good times pass, this wasn't meant to last<br />The road went by so fast<br />remember</p>
<p>Yours and mine, it was an awesome time<br />I'm sure that you'll be fine<br />I'm moving on</p>
<p>Yours and mine, it was an awesome time<br />I'm sure that you'll be fine<br />I'm moving on</p>
<p>The lights have gone out, you look up at your star<br />The hands of the clock have to be where they are<br />And nothing and no one can change you this far<br />Because you know that while it lasted...<br />While it lasted...</p>
<p>Good times pass, this wasn't meant to last<br />The road went by so fast<br />remember</p>
<p>Yours and mine, it was an awesome time<br />I'm sure that you'll be fine<br />I'm moving on</p>
<p>Yours and mine, it was an awesome time<br />I'm sure that you'll be fine<br />I'm moving on</p>
