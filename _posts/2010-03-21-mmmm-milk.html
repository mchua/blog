<p>I am very, for instance - I grew up with it and so prefer it - and one glass of cow's milk is generally all right with my digestive system.</p>
<p>However, Meadville... has fresh milk. Whole milk. With chocolate in it. Served in glass bottles. Freshly obtained from free-range, no-antibiotics cows from a meadow right nearby. It's thick and creamy and sweet and tastes like a milkshake, if milkshakes were light and infused with sunshine. And the first time I encountered it (today) I intended to stop with one small cup, and ended up drinking 3 glasses in quick succession. And I usually don't even <i>like</i> cow's milk.</p>
<p>I've been spending the last few hours alternately cleaning up the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Marketing_FAD_2010">Marketing FAD</a> page and clutching my stomach and groaning a bit, but it was <i>so</i> worth it. I want more. And I think I'll go get some lactose tablets the next time I go into town.</p>
<p>In other news, Meadville has wonderful food.</p>
