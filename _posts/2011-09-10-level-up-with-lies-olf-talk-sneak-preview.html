<p>I'm speaking at <a href="https://ohiolinux.org">Ohio LinuxFest</a> tomorrow with a talk titled <a href="https://ohiolinux.org/talks#LIES">Level-up with Lies, Damned Lies, and Statistics: Turn Your Life Into a Data-driven Video Game with FOSS.</a> Why should you come?</p>
<ol>
<li>This talk has <i>five</i> slidedecks. The audience will get to choose when and how I use each one, resulting in some odd self-looping variant on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerpoint-Karaoke">Powerpoint Karaoke.</a> </li>
<li>I will sing solo in public for the first time in 13 years (when I had a bit part as radio host Bert Healy in my middle school's production of <i>Annie</i>).</li>
<li>The following picture is one of my slides.</li>

<p>Unlike previous talks I've done, I have no freakin' idea how I'm going to capture this one for a future audience, because it's so deliberately improvisational and nonlinear. <b>If you have a video camera, please bring it and film!</b> I'll see what I can do afterwards.</p>
