<p>Today... was a decompression day. I spent Saturday feeling more and more introverted and getting more passive-aggressively grumpy as a result - I'd simply reached my Too Much Peopleness quota. This happens after extended periods of time in contact with large groups of strangers, and I need solitude to recharge.</p>
<p>It inadvertently started last night after sushi, when I lay down to rest my (swollen) knee and simply... didn't wake up again until 3:30am, having slept through 2 alarms, Robyn coming in and out, lights turning on and off... I was dead to the world. Woke up at 3:30, 5:30, and 8:30, each time vacillating somewhat miserably between the need to rest (not so much to sleep - which I needed too - but to <i>be by myself for a while</i>) and guilt over being unable to do work when I attempted to do so. At 8:30, when Robyn got up, I decided <i>screw it, I'm going to sleep</i>. My naps became immediately more restful thereafter, but I've still only gotten sleep in bits and snatches.</p>
<p>Dancing helped. There's blues in Portland every Sunday night, so I took the bus up and spun around in my socks for about 2 hours. I even got asked for repeat dances, which... was flattering, but nice. I was definitely hindered slightly by my knee, which would occasionally send stabbing jolts up my leg, but it was a good night, a night of solid connections. A lot of leads with gentle, subtle styles, which was perfect for my energy level (low) and my knee (ouch) and what I wanted to do (listen quietly, not get flung around the room). One lead complimented me on my "good instincts." I nearly laughed; they're not so much instincts as they are years of getting over paranoia, and I'm still not all that great. But I did do a few dips tonight, which surprised me, and it was a good way to turn my brain off for a little while. Live band, too.</p>
<p>Reading and writing is a good way to get my functionality back. My ability to process audio is one of the things that drops out when I'm tired - actually, realizing that it has is a good indication to me that I'm tired. My ability to process text is one of the last things to go (if I ever lose it, I'm <i>really</i> in trouble, and I can only remember it happening once in recent memory). It's challenging to rest, because sleep... is hard. But I can go upstairs and play guitar. The team is in the lobby (so am I) and they're playing poker (I've been writing).</p>
<p>Highest priority tomorrow is slides, slides slides slides. Slides and being present at OSCON; I'm trying to be more gentle with myself about recharging so I can actually take the event on full-steam. There's a lot I want to learn, a lot of people I want to meet, a lot of stuff I want to do, but I've got to be in a shape to do it. HOOYAH. Will make it through! I'll be good and tired when I reach Chicago this weekend (visiting my parents for a few days, by request).</p>
<p>It's a long summer, but a good one. I will... collapse in August. I'll have the time and space I need to breathe then. It'll be good.</p>
