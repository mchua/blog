<p><em>Part of the QualMIP </em>series,  <em> introduced <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/%22http://blog.melchua.com/2016/01/19/qualmip-starting-agreements-fieldwork-focus-grace-weeks-sustainability-and-more/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Sparse notes again because of the busy time,   but today each person:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Gave an overview of the data collection/analysis they did over the past two weeks</span></li>
<li>Had someone else in the group write an "abstract" consisting of 3-6 points they saw throughout our reported data. After a time of trying to diverge and divest ourselves of as many filters as possible, we are starting to converge and filter once again -- but this time, much more consciously.</li>
<li>Figured out what research paradigm they seemed to be working in (everyone is interpretivistÂ for this project; I re-presented a version of the main paradigms for this discussion).</li>
<li>Honed down on their unit of analysis and research question (by me giving examples and then everybody iterating on theirs with studio critique).</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the last week before our Data Collection Cutoff. A constant part of our iterative focus is trying to make sure that our data and questions coevolve in such a way that the data can answer the questions. (I'm also thinking on how this dynamic scales up the next time I teach this as a course; I suspect more scaffolding and possibly even some readings will appear.)</p>
<p>We also looked at the classic paper <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~palys/Miner-1956-BodyRitualAmongTheNacirema.pdf">"Body Ritual Among the Nacirema"</a> as an example of... well, I'll leave it to the reader to decide what one could use it as an example of -- quite a few things, as it turns out. (It wasn't assigned reading; we read parts of it aloud in studio, so my "no readings" rule stands unbroken.)</p>
