<p>A few years ago, the <a href="http://www.capetowndeclaration.org/">Cape Town Open Education Declaration</a> came out. It seems almost ho-hum to read it now in late 2011, but back in September 2007, having a group of educators - not just hackers who were already immersed in FOSS culture,Â <em>teachers and administrators and government officials </em>- come together, not in the US or Europe where FOSS is most prevalent, but in <em>South Africa</em> - and declare that open education content, hardware, and software were vital to the future... that was pretty big stuff.</p>
<p>Of course, there were <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/icommons/Week-of-Mon-20080121/001153.html">spoofs</a> (this one by David Berry) criticizing the declaration for encouraging Large Evil Capitalist Machines to Exploit The Light Of Free Knowledge. However, I agree with David Wiley's <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/451">response </a>(also read SJ's <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/icommons/Week-of-Mon-20080121/001172.html">reply</a>). To make something "free," it's got to be free to all - including corporations and those seeking profit. As long as the knowledge itself is out there, it's up to anyone who wants to <em>do</em> something with them - because while ideas do change the world, they do so through the actions they inspire, empower, and inform.</p>
<p>I bring this up again today for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the "Exploit The Light Of Free Knowledge!" front, I've spent more time than I'd like recently explaining things like <a href="http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses/NC">NonCommercial Clause Considered Harmful</a> to people. I know it's scary, but when you commit to going open, you won't get all the benefits unless you go all the way.</li>
<li>Sometimes, when we're staring seemingly impossible problems in the face, it's nice to be reminded that we <em>have </em>changed the world, and much faster than anyone ever expected. We've changed it so quickly and so much, in fact, that oftentimes we forget we've changed it at all.</li>
</ol>
