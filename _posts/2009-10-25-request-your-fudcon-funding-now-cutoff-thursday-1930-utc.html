<p>We'd like to wrap up <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:FUDCon_Toronto_2009_budget">budgeting</a> for <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:Toronto_2009">FUDCon Toronto 2009</a> as the happy date draws nearer. And we need your help. <b>Ask us for money!</b></p>
<p>We have budget set aside to help with the travel of community members who would not otherwise be able to afford the trip to FUDCon. Instructions are at <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:Toronto_2009#Requesting_funding">http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:Toronto_2009#Requesting_funding.</a> These are the same instructions that everyone who indicated a need for funding help during <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:Toronto_2009#Pre-registration">pre-registration</a> got. We've been processing those funding applications for the past few weeks, and we wanted to make absolutely sure that everyone who wanted to request funding has gotten a chance to do so before the cutoff date, <b>Thursday October 29 at 19:30 UTC.</b> Our budget is finite in size, but we are doing our best to bring as many people over as possible, and are making our decision process completely transparent - the instructions on how to request funding also have a link to meeting logs so you can see how we've made the choices that we did so far.</p>
<p>One note: If you're on the fence and wondering whether you should request funding or not, <i>please ask</i>. The more we know about what people need, the more we can figure out the best way to help - for instance, even if we can't fully fund someone, we might be able to partially fund them, or hook them up with a carpool or a bus seat, or find a way for them to <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:Toronto_2009#Documentation">participate remotely</a>. As someone who would have, a year ago, probably <i>not</i> sent in a funding application due to a desire not to cause any extra trouble, I can honestly say (as this FUDCon's co-planner) that <i>giving us this information actually helps us plan</i>. So you'd be doing us a favor, really. Seriously, ASK.</p>
<p>Heck, even if you don't need funding to come to FUDCon, putting your FUDCon plans in the pre-registration table would be awesome, so that folks can find out who's up to what. So in short, the request:
<ol>
<li>If you need FUDCon travel funding, <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:Toronto_2009#Requesting_funding">ask for it</a>. Before Thursday 19:30 UTC.</li>
<li>If you don't need FUDCon travel funding, <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:Toronto_2009#Pre-registration">tell us what you're doing anyway</a>. Having a game plan to adapt and improvise from (and occasionally completely throw away) often makes for a better event experience, because you come in with a target goal in mind.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks - we'll see you in Toronto in a few weeks!</p>
