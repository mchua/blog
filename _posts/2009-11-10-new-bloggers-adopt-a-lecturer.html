<p>Dear Planet bloggers: How do you learn how to read and make sense of - and write - good blog posts for an open source project's planet?</p>
<p>We're in the middle of a <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_APAC">POSSE in Singpaore</a>, and some of the attending lecturers have started blogging - here they are describing <a href="http://jaricsng.wordpress.com/2009/11/09/posse-first-day/">some confusing issues running Fedora 11 in virtualbox</a>, asking for <a href="http://tiraths.wordpress.com/2009/11/10/posse-day-2/">help understanding wireshark error messages</a> and questions about <a href="http://xcliu.wordpress.com/2009/11/09/hello-world/#comments">why open source community members blog.</a> We've also got a few lecturers who <a href="http://lsystem.wordpress.com/">haven't</a> <a href="http://rchiun.wordpress.com/">yet</a> <a href="http://sst.unisim.edu.sg/sites/osom/">started</a> posting, but will shortly, so stay tuned!</p>
<p>We need to work out some FAS group membership stuff, but should be<br />
getting them on Planet Fedora and Planet TOS sometime today. Also, be aware that for the most part, English is not their first<br />
language - though that's actually pretty cool, because we might start<br />
seeing multilingual blogs pop up as they go back to their classrooms<br />
and get their students involved.</p>
<p><b>If you have a moment, please check out their posts and leave a comment</b>, especially if you can answer some of their questions or point them in the direction of an answer. I want to show them how blogging can help other people find out what they're up to - and how it can also help them find out what their students are up to. </p>
<p><i>Writing progress notes on blogging, IRC, and wiki usage on the board - for people who are becoming open source contributors for the first time, these tools make for a strange new world indeed.</i><br /><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="http://blog.melchua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/posse-lecturers.jpg" /></p>
