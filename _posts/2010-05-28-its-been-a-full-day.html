<ol>
<li>Go to sleep at 2am</li>
<li>Wake up a bit after 5am</li>
<li>Work a bit</li>
<li>Drive a friend to the airport (have fun at WisCon, Sumana!)</li>
<li>Work a bit more</li>
<li>Hack on <a href="http://github.com/stenoknight/Plover">open steno software</a> for a bit (or rather, fail to install Tkinter in Python 3 - I'll do this when I upgrade to F13 this weekend - but learn how to chord "hello, world" on a steno keyboard and get an orientation to the code enough to start tinkering with new features - thanks, Mirabai!)</li>
<li>Meetings and conversations</li>
<li>Drive back to Boston, periodically interrupted by...</li>
<li>POSSE California meeting</li>
<li>Free hot dogs</li>
<li>Traffic (ok, this part not so fun - New York and Boston are <i>not</i> over 7 hours apart)</li>
<li>Arrive at Blues Union, dance until you're basically a pile of sweaty clothes collapsed onto a chair</li>
<li>Drive home with radio on and windows down so as to stay awake and not run car into tree</li>
<li>Shower</li>
<li>Emails and various small work-things</li>
<li>2am POSSE China meeting</li>
</ol>
<p>I've got a red, white, and blue thread bracelet around my right wrist that will stay on for the next few days - it's the marker for <a href="http://www.dancebix.com/">bix</a>, which goes through late Monday night. This weekend, I am a dancer. </p>
<p>And a hacker. Three things I want to tinker with over the long weekend:
<ul>
<li>Upgrade my infrastructure (work laptop, deployment netbook collection, trove-of-ancient-hardware) to F13 and whatnot, reallocate hardware as needed and install new programs that have been on my list for a while.</li>
<li>Offlineimap + postfix adventures with Karsten</li>
<li>Plover feature coding for Mirabai</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, food and sleep and stretching and rest and thinking and yay. And clearing email backlog. So much backlog...</p>
<p>Not a bad life, really. Certainly a full one.</p>
