<p>I was reminded of a thought by this presentation (a fantastic, language, and the conventions of scientific talks - and it's <em>subtitled</em>).</p>

<p>"You're like a puppy," Jenn Martinez sometimes told me when I was dancing in Boston. "Little puppy Mel." A smart little puppy, but a puppy nonetheless. When there is something I'm trying to understand, I'll look at it, and almost instantly I'll think "Hm... hrrrrmmm. Poke, poke. Poke-poke-poke - ooo! Well, okay, but... but... <i>why</i>?" And the busy little whip-smart puppy goes <i>oh boy!</i> and starts earnestly digging away in its neat little intellectual flowerbeds, strewing magnolias and asparagus here and there. When it's productive and happy, it ends up sounding a lot like Wehrli sometimes - funny, sharp, but also sometimes just <i>missing</i> something (consciously, deliberately!) beyond the intellect that most people would think of as the <i>point</i>.</p>
<p>"Come here, little puppy. Time to go inside." <i>But but digging! happy happy dig dig dig...</i> "No, no, you have to eat. It's getting dark soon." <i>Dig dig dig! Diggety dig dig...</i> "Dinnertime? Hungry puppy?" <i>Diggety dig happy happy digging puppy! Happy digging puppy is happy, and... and... cold. Mraaa. Cold puppy. But digging! Diggety dig dig. Happy! But... cold. Cold puppy? </i>"Yes, it gets colder when it's night-time. Come inside for dinner now?" <i>But the digging! Digging, digging! But but... wait, is hungry.</i> "Yes, that's why it's dinnertime." <i>Dinnertime! Dinnertime! Dinner dinner nom nom nom happy puppy happy happy omnomnom!</i> "Good puppy." <i>Good puppy! Nommmmm. Dig?</i></p>
<p>Sigh. What can you do?</p>
<p>It's a very efficient little puppy when you need to dig away in intellectual flowerbeds - and there's plenty there! - but try to tell it <i>where</i> to dig, or to stop digging - or to start if it doesn't want to - or to come heel because it's time for a walk or a bath or a vet trip - and it gaily ignores you. If you drag it into line - and I have quite a bit of willpower and can <i>force</i> myself to do a lot - it whimpers, bewildered, and begins to panic, flounder, and pout. And sometimes snap back. </p>
<p><i>No no no not happy puppy happy puppy wants to dig! Why no dig? Does not want vet, does not want vet, bad bad mean person! Graaaaa! Dig dig dig! But... but... dig! </i></p>
<p>There are things outside of intellectual flowerbeds. And some of my most treasured moments are when that puppy, for some reason or another, stops digging for a moment - just a moment - and watches the leaves falling with that same wide-eyed happy curiosity, but also an open calmness. Or comes back and circles around my ankles, yipping cheerfully and going <i>found something! found something! come see, come see, share shiny thing with you!</i> Or best of all, when it comes over and cocks its head and looks at you, then matter-of-factly climbs into your lap and promptly falls asleep there, breathing deeply, warm and soft in your arms.</p>
<p>You know it's going to wake up and go back to <i>happy puppy dig dig dig!</i> soon, and that if it learns to do anything else, it will be slow and painful and probably take a long time, and so you cherish the calm times in the moments when they happen. And you know that you can't really make them happen on command, but gosh, it's <i>hard</i> not to love a happy puppy who's just so dang cheerful about digging and wants to share it! With <i>you!</i></p>
<p>Frustrating, endearing, keeps you on your toes. Me and my brain and my self and my willpower, that's what it feels like sometimes.</p>
