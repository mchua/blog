<p>I'm tossing this post out as a project notebook for something I'm building with Davin and Esteban this semester. The project is semi-secret, but the code is public (at least for now).</p>
<p>It's my first foray into Processing, which I'm glad to say is a <em>phenomenally </em>documented programming languages. So many tutorials and code examples! I can pick it up by writing it, which isn't true of all programming languages. (Low-level languages, functional languages, and all variants of LISP, I'm looking at you. Yes, you. Maybe there are good books about you, but without a book, there'd be no hope for me.)</p>
<p>Anyway. The <a href="https://github.com/mchua/davinted/blob/master/sketch_03_quadrants_onscreen">current baby experimental code</a> continuously computes and displays the brightness of each quadrant of a video feed. That's it.</p>
<p><em>Image description: A video screenshot of Mel standing in front of a whiteboard, blocking out the top-left video quadrant with a black object. The screen is divided into 4 quadrants, and a number in the center of each quadrant displays the brightness level of that quadrant. The blacked-out quadrant's value is approximately 24, whereas the other (not-blacked-out) quadrants are 122, 107, and 96.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;">This is enough for Davin and Esteban to start with, but I have a couple possible next steps to improve this code:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can probably split some repetitive code out into separate functions. (Not a high priority, I'll fix it when it starts to hurt more.)</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Scale out to other video sizes/sources.</span></li>
<li>Scale the brightness value output so it goes from 0-100 instead of 0 to... some max value I don't know (but should find out).</li>
<li>Make a "calibration" function that sets the 0 point of brightness for a quadrant when you click on it. This is sort of like the white-balance setting on cameras -- if one quadrant is dimmer than the rest because of lighting, etc. we can have it work off a different baseline.</li>
<li>Improve the computational efficiency (although I don't know if I care, since if brute-forcing loops runs fast enough, why bother?)</li>
<li>Find output interfaces for Processing so I can pipe the quadrant brightness data out to other things (do I want this sketch to output JSON, or... what?)</li>
</ol>
