<div><em>This  post was originally from but Movable Type is  being grouchy tonight, so I'm posting it on mine by his request.</em></div>
<div><em><br />
</em></div>
<div>We  are in Doha right now, getting ready for teaching a new experimental  iteration of the POSSE curriculum format. We just got back from dinner  with Saquib Razak and Affan Syed, who'll be working with us tomorrow -  we had a great time, interesting conversations and stories (more to be  told at FUDCon) and even ice cream afterwards. For those new to POSSE,  it is a week-long workshop for college and university faculty who want  to get their students involved in contributing to open source  communities. The workshop introduces professors to how open source  works, how to make a contribution (tools and culture), and how to fit  these sorts of experiences into their classrooms and the context of a  school year.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="magicdomid10">One  consistent piece of feedback we've gotten is that a week is too long  for faculty travel and can we please shorten POSSE and/or make it  remote? We've now taken a stab at that and are gearing up for the  following schedule in Doha:</div>
<div></div>
<div id="magicdomid248"><strong>Day 1:</strong> <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_modules#POSSE_001_-_POSSE_intensive">POSSE intensive.</a> What  we've done is to split the existing curriculum into a one-day one-day  in-person kickoff session (~5 hours of instruction), and then require a  (remote) curriculum comprised of bite-sized modules. Note that each  module is capped at 5 hours of student work (usually around 2 hours of  (IRC-based) instruction + 3 hours of exploratory "homework"), for a  total of 25 hours for the core modules + 10 hours for electives (a  minimum of 2 required). Attendees finish with a "capstone" of attendance  at a conference with a significant TOS presence (SIGCSE, FIE, OSCON).  Total time required: 40 hours + conference. It'll take more than a week -  maybe it'll even take a year - but this might be more flexible and  manageable for academics.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="magicdomid16"><strong>Day  2:</strong> We're going to create marketing materials for info sessions that  faculty can use to explain POSSE and <a href="http://teachingopensource.org">Teaching Open Source</a> at their  institutions. We've been getting feedback that these sorts of things  were lacking, so we thought we'd take this time to actually make them  alongside the Doha attendees. We'll also be incorporating feedback on  the POSSE intensive curriculum from the day before.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="magicdomid247"><strong>Day  3:</strong> I [Sebastian] am planning on doing some work looking back into  Etherpad on this day. My RSI is still acting up, though, so I have the  challenge of figuring out how to contribute to Fedora without typing...  creative suggestions welcome. I'm thinking I might use this as an  opportunity to work on my speaking and presentation skills.</div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div id="magicdomid22"><strong>What you can do to help:</strong> Look  at the <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_modules">POSSE intensive curriculum</a> and let us know whether these classes  sound like something you'd be interested in taking (remotely), or  classes you wish you could offer to other people getting started in  their contributions to open source. Basically, are we on the right track  to teaching the right things, and describing them attractively?</div>
