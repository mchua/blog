<p><em>A couple folks at my alma mater, <a href="http://olin.edu">Olin College</a>, are trying to connect current and past students via a project they call "Banter." I can't make the first (online) meeting, so I'm making up this little intro to introduce myself. Some acronyms may not make sense to non-Oliners.</em></p>
<p>Hey, Banter folks. I'm Mel, Olin '07.</p>
<p>This is me during my first year at Olin -- Spring 2004. I was 17. I think I pulled an allnighter immediately before this video was shot.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bIZw2UczICA" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>I don't pull allnighters any more -- I gave them up for Lent my Junior year at Olin and never went back. I do pull the occasional late night for grad school (I'm in my 2nd year of the <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ENE/Academics/Graduate/WhyEngrEd">Engineering Education PhD program at Purdue</a>, where my professors let me do things like <a href="http://de.scribd.com/doc/67702423/What-is-Engineering">turn in comic books instead of papers</a>) but since I'm dancing now (modern and blues, taking my first jazz class this semester; I started last May as a 26-year-old beginner), I actually take recovery time from that afterwards.</p>
<p>Aside from engineering education and the dancing thing, I've gotten increasingly involved in <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/category/hearing/">hearing technologies</a>, mostly because I'm considering a cochlear implant (I'm deaf) and, as a SparkE, want to understand anything I'm thinking about putting inside my skull. Weirdly enough, I have affinities for audio-dependent (for most people) hobbies -- music, dancing, languages, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>While at Olin, I did ARB and FWOP (the backstage portion) and Frankly Speaking and some SMAC and accidentally designed a teddy bear that (just as accidentally) got on Engadget and NINJA'd every non-AHS first-year class except Design Nature and a lot of other things that contributed to a large sleep debt. I have a big, loud, crazy Chinese family I love to pieces, and one of my great joys now is reconnecting with them (I wasn't great about that when I was in college).</p>
<p>What else? Oh. Between Olin and grad school I spent my time in the open source world, travelling around the world to hack on things around the "open source and education" intersection. <a href="&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/hsrn2TPQLyI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;">Here's</a> a longer video that gives a snapshot of some of the stuff I did, but it's long (5 minutes) so you can skip it. I love travel -- flying to new places, wandering through old ones, long drives with friends, late nights, good food. I write like a maniac. I grew up in Illinois and am in Indiana right now for grad school and really, really miss living in a city.</p>
<p>That's probably enough for now -- feel free to ping me if you've got any questions!</p>
