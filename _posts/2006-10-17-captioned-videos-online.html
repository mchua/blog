<p>One reason I love the internet is that it's historically text-based and therefore accessible to me. One fear I've had is that we're moving towards audio and video content that I can't hear or understand.</p>
<p>I suppose I shouldn't have worried. Three projects that prove why:</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/html/cmusphinx.php">Sphinx</a>, an open-source voice recognition engine developed at CMU. You can set this baby up yourself - in fact, DJ got an install running on his Olin laptop in the casual span of an evening. And it's on par for accuracy with commercial packages.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.informedia.cs.cmu.edu/">Informedia</a>, a software suite (also by CMU) that I'd describe as "automatic closed-captioning for videos." Using the Sphinx engine, it automatically processes your movies and gives you a stream of text time-synced with the video itself. That means you can textually search movies and have it jump to specific spots in the recorded conversation.</p>
<p>3. Google video... <a href="http://video.google.com/videocaptioned">with captions</a>. The result of something like Informedia being applied to all the media content out there.</p>
<p>Hurrah for all the people behind these creations! I hunger for information - things like this open up a whole section of the world's data to me.</p>
