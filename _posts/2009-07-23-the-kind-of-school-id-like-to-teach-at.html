<p>Matt asked me what kind of school I'd like to teach at once I get out of grad school. I hadn't given this any thought before (I haven't even gotten <em>into</em> grad school yet) but it's a good one. Here's a stab at it. Braindumping.</p>
<p>I know what I <em>don't</em> want.</p>
<ul>
<li>A school that measures me solely by my research output and treats teaching as second-class - or worse, an annoyance that one has to put up with in order to DO RESEARCH!!! (Don't get me wrong; research is awesome, and I enjoy it and look forward to doing more of it - but it's not the end-all-be-all of my existence, and can never be.)</li>
<li>A school that won't let me be an engineering prof who does research on education. I want my engineering education research to count towards any "research" requirement I may have as a faculty member.</li>
<li>A school that does not give its students the flexibility to design their own courses and paths of study. I need them to have room to move in order for me to help them move in it. And possibly past it.</li>
<li>A school that does not value efforts (on my own part, if need be) to improve my teaching.</li>
<li>A school that relentlessly hounds me to get more grant monies in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hm. This is starting to sound like the inverse of an "I do want this" list.</p>
<ul>
<li>Somewhere that values teaching ability - evaluates you based on it, at least in part (student evaluations, actual teaching effectiveness - not a popularity contest, but whether they learned stuff - I realize no metric and no instrument will ever be perfect for this)</li>
<li>Somewhere I <em>can</em> do cool research, cross-disciplinary research, collaborative research with other faculty outside my own department, <em>education</em> research... somewhere other professors won't be averse to me studying them and their classes for my research, too!</li>
<li>Somewhere with flexible student paths, and students who can and will take advantage of the design-your-own-path option.</li>
<li>Somewhere that will let me travel, present, take sabbaticals, consult, etc... and keep on working on awesome open source and education stuff. Perhaps as part of classes or research - this doesn't have to be separate - but... it has to be there.</li>
<li>It would be nice if this were somewhere in or near a city. Maybe this will change as I grow older, but I <em>need</em> the city right now, need the exposure, the stimulation I craved for so many years and finally got to experience in my late teens. Cities are a <em>push</em> experience. You can't help but see things there. I haven't been exposed to enough yet to be able to have a good <em>pull</em> experience out of the city - I don't know what to look for, what I should be pulling in.</li>
<li>A place with colleagues I want to grow up to become. I'm not sure how easy mentors will be to find as I run helter-skelter further down this quirky path I seem to be drawing out (barely ahead of where I'm running), but I want teachers too!</li>
<li>And quite honestly, a school I would <em>want</em> to be the President of someday. Not that it will happen, or that I want it to (I tend to run away from titles and positions of power, in general) but it's a good litmus test for an institution as a whole; is it an institution I would want responsibility for? I can't just go to a school based on one department and think that I'll be able to insulate myself in there. The whole dang institution has to be a place where I can move, or I'll get stuck fast.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stuff that I actually don't care about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What country it's in. (I love the US, but I don't have to teach here all the time - maybe another continent might be more receptive.)</li>
<li>I struggle to say this, and I'm not convinced I don't care about it yet, but I don't think I should: prestige. Yes, it would make a lot of things easier. But part of the point I want to chase down is that you don't have to be part of $famous-university to make a big difference. That other types of schools are <em>better</em>, even, for doing certain types of Awesome. That there are different types of schools, not one giant number line with "good" schools on one side and "lesser" schools on the other.</li>
<li>How "smart" my students are.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last bit needs some explanation. I mean... well, here. I want them to be smart! But I love teaching students who are much, much smarter than they think they are. I can't do much with kids who know they're smart and strut around proving it (they're all set, aside from learning to tone down the cockiness and work with people - and I can do that, but it's not the best use of my time). And I can't teach students who are so stuck in their ways of thinking, or so apathetic, or so... self-promotion-seeking (there must be a better term) that all they want is to check off a bunch of boxes and get a piece of paper, thank you very much, goodbye.</p>
<p>But I <em>can</em> teach frightened newbies (this is <em>very</em> far from what I want to say, but it's the closest English phrase I can produce right now). They're the ones I've historically been the best with - uniquely the best with, in the sense that kids I worked with well, nobody else had found a way to really help them before and other folks saw them as not worth the bother. The quiet ones who wouldn't do stuff anyway - the ones who have to be asked. Asked, coached, persuaded of their own awesomeness, applauded when they start taking initiative, pushed hard, and loved.</p>
<p>Kids like me. I feel like I just barely made it through on a wing and a prayer, that there were so many chasms I could have fallen into along the... geez, has it been 17 years already? of my education, that... by all means, I should have slipped through the cracks and <em>really</em> not be anywhere near where I am now. I won't list the many reasons here, but you can probably guess a bunch if you know me. I often see people frustrated, stuck, behind, confused, failing... and look at them and think that there but for the grace of God go I. And then I think "well hell, if I barely made it, how many people didn't? How much potential are we wasting? If I managed to make it through and N others like me didn't, don't I owe it to those folks to make sure that the value of N diminishes like crazy - diminishes until it's 0?"</p>
<p>I don't know how much this helps in figuring out what kind of school I want to teach at, Matt - but this is what I'm thinking now.</p>
<p>I also don't <em>have</em> to teach. I don't have to be a professor. I'm running towards it because it's the best way I can see to get the stuff I want to happen to happen. Nothing else I've seen comes close. But there's a lot I haven't seen.</p>
<p>What I want to happen is for the kind of learning that goes on in  open source communities to be as valid as the kind that happens in  universities - particulary with the engineering stuff - and I want it to happen by the two things becoming the  same, and if these changes can happen better with me in a different role  than I'm planning now, or even without me, then that is what I will do.  I want that legacy before I die, but it doesn't need to be my legacy. Doesn't matter who does the job so long as it gets done.</p>
<p>I hate credentialism, and know that it may be the case that I would learn to <strong class="moz-txt-star"></strong><em><span class="moz-txt-star">be</span></em> more  effective in these areas by investing my time in things other than going  to school. My goal in going to grad school is to be the last person who <span class="moz-txt-star"><em>has</em></span><strong class="moz-txt-star"></strong> to get into the ivory tower to make these kinds of changes within  it. Some doors are most effectively unlocked from the inside. However, if I can be convinced that I'm more effective unlocking those  doors from not-the-inside, I will do that instead. It's just... the door of academia seems like it's locked so tightly, built so thick, placed so high-up - what effect will any things I work on have within the ivory tower if they can't get into it in the first place? If I become part of the gatekeeper, perhaps I can open the gate.</p>
<p>It's not the only way to do it, sure. But it's the best I know of so far. And I'd love to be corrected.</p>
