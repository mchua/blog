<p>Congratulations to newlyweds Ian and Elinor (my second cousin Achi Nono), who could not stop looking at each other and laughing during their vows today. (Yes, it was very cute.) I wish you both a long and happy life together.</p>
<p>The wedding was <em>fun</em>. (I'm still somewhat in shock; I don't typically associate those two words.) I have illustrative diagrams from it that I shall post at some point. At one point in the wedding they walked around the tables to get the guests to dance while Ian played Paul McCartney's "Dance Tonight" on a mandolin. In other news, I'm borrowing Ian's electric mandolin for the forseeable future, and at some point will figure out a way to get it to them in Beijing (where they are apparently moving for three years for work starting in July).</p>
<p>My family is awesome. Ian has just made it awesomer. Welcome to the clan!</p>
