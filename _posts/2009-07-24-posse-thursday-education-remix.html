<p>Sebastian Dziallas put together a <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/education/wiki/GetStarted">Fedora Education Remix</a> LiveCD for the <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_2009">POSSE</a> professors to take home. It contains development tools and documentation bookmarks for the projects they worked on this week as well as several other open-source-and-education software projects that might be interesting communities to help with (like <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> and <a href="http://sugarlabs.org/">Sugar</a>).</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="http://blog.melchua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/cimg4145.jpg" /></p>
<p>The objective is to have a LiveCD that can be handed out to classes of students tasked with working on an open source project so that they can minimize their build/dev/contributing environment setup time, and so teachers know they can rely on all their students having a working version of a certain set of programs.</p>
<p>v.1.0 is now live and in the hands of professors for testing - based on this week, there are definitely improvements to be made for v.1.1. I think we're missing some tools to complete all of the POSSE exercises, but can't say exactly what those are until I go through the curriculum again next week - it's hard to shoot at a moving target. (It's also kind of fun.) Usage and experimentation and testing and feedback (and help) is very, very welcome.</p>
<p>Thanks, Sebastian!</p>
