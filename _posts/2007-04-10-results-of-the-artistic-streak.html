<p>I said I was going to do some art tonight, it's not perfect, but I'm going to stop now. Yes, I want to replace it all with textpattern templates, but I'll do that later.)</p>
<p>I believe this has provided me with enough momentum in <span style="font-style: italic;">making</span> stuff that I can actually work on things that actually count for credit now. This is good. I also have to wake up in less than four hours. This is not so good.</p>
<p>Onwards to the sleep, then forwards in the systematic reduction of responsibilities.</p>
