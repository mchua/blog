<p><span class="fancy">My Catholic upbringing is showing. After writing the last post, I was reminded of a prayer that I've always seen as rather fuddy-duddy, but can also be filled with the urgent rhythm of youthful drumming... depending on how you read it. Goes something like this, typesetting mine; imagine a low chanting in unison on on the parenthesized words, and a pulsing bass beat, and a rough, high, almost-straining tenor. The feeling of being filled with something great that goes beyond you, and <i>is</i> you, and <i>through</i> you.<br /></span><br />
<blockquote><i><span class="fancy">(come) holy spirit</span><br /><span class="fancy">(come) fill the hearts<br />(come) the hearts of your faithful<br />(come) kindle in them<br />(come) kindle the fire</p>
<p>the fire of love</p>
<p>(send) forth thy spirit<br />(send) forth to be created<br />(send) forth thy spirit<br />(send) forth to renew</p>
<p>to renew the earth<br />let us pray.</p>
<p>o god, who did<br />who did instruct the hearts<br />the hearts of the faithful<br />by your light</p>
<p>(come) grant in us<br />(come) by that same spirit</p>
<p>to be truly wise<br />to ever rejoice</p>
<p>(amen.)<br /></span></i></p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if<i> that's </i>what people feel like when they pray.</p>
