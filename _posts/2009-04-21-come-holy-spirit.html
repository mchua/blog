<p><span class="fancy">My Catholic upbringing is showing. After writing the last post, but can also be filled with the urgent rhythm of youthful drumming... depending on how you read it. Goes something like this, typesetting mine; imagine a low chanting in unison on on the parenthesized words, and a pulsing bass beat, and a rough, high, almost-straining tenor. The feeling of being filled with something great that goes beyond you, and <i>is</i> you, and <i>through</i> you.<br /></span><br />
<blockquote><i><span class="fancy">(come) holy spirit</span><br /><span class="fancy">(come) fill the hearts<br />(come) the hearts of your faithful<br />(come) kindle in them<br />(come) kindle the fire</p>
<p>the fire of love</p>
<p>(send) forth thy spirit<br />(send) forth to be created<br />(send) forth thy spirit<br />(send) forth to renew</p>
<p>to renew the earth<br />let us pray.</p>
<p>o god, who did<br />who did instruct the hearts<br />the hearts of the faithful<br />by your light</p>
<p>(come) grant in us<br />(come) by that same spirit</p>
<p>to be truly wise<br />to ever rejoice</p>
<p>(amen.)<br /></span></i></p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if<i> that's </i>what people feel like when they pray.</p>
