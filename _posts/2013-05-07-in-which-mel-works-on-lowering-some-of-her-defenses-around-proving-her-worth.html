<p>I begin the writing of this blog post stiffly,   with defenses up; I'm conscious that they're up, and want to look at them and see if I can... do something about that.</p>
<p>*deep breath*</p>
<p>I am required,   at least once a month, to "update" certain organizations on my "progress" so they'll continue providing me with "disability services." (Note the quotes; I'm already speaking defensively.) I understand the "need" to track progress and prevent resource abuse, and I do appreciate my hearing aids and realtime transcription in my classes and want ("but don't <em>need,"</em> my pride hurriedly adds) to keep them, all else being equal -- but it's not. I got an update request and immediately saw myself snap into BATTLE MODE, choosing to read it as a challenge to prove my "worth" as a  "return" on their "investment," rattling off my international travel schedule, the publication status of my book, board appointments, featured speaker invitations, news clippings on awards I've won, etc. It's a destructively competitive framing: if I outperform the majority of people you see as less-broken-than-me, the vision of me-as-broken must be wrong.</p>
<p>It <em>must </em>be wrong. If it were right, I'd somehow be a lesser Mel -- and when I was 7, I thought I was. <em>My </em>human worth wasn't intrinsic; it was earned by constantly generating school/work output. I remember deciding to protect my 7-year-old self from a world I didn't trust to treat her right. "You're <em>worth </em>it, little Mel," I'd whisper. "I'm <em>big </em>now (I was 8), and I will keep that statement true by <em>doing things</em> to justify your worth!"* Say what you will about using anger as a fuel, but I'm pretty sure my joyful, puppy-like wide-eyed wonder wouldn't have survived without the barricade powered by outrage that something so <em>happy </em>and <em>good </em>as Small Mel Self should be in danger.</p>
<p>As I edit, I realize I'm writing this in the past tense, standing in a present where I do not need that barricade. My automatic reactions are based on beliefs I no longer hold. Everyone, <em>including me</em>, is intrinsically worthwhile; there are no Broken People. So why would I react as if I were scared of being something ontologically impossible?</p>
<p>Habit. Yep. Should stop that now. (Easier said than done -- but easier than I used to think it'd be.)</p>
<p>*Christians may recognize echoes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_fide#Catholic_view">Sola Fide</a> here, albeit from the weirdly primitive perspective of a 2nd-grader who hadn't yet <em>quite </em>reached Piaget's formal-operational stage. The Catholic perspective, as I understand it at the moment, is that faith <em>does </em>justify -- <em>and </em>that God grants us (through our faith) the grace to do the works which constantly perfect our justification. So we keep on growing -- but that doesn't mean we're broken. It just means we're... growing.</p>
