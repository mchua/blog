<p>Some of you may have noticed some new faces around the Sugar community - we (Walter Bender, Peter Robinson, and I) are hanging out with a group of professors (mostly from the Worcester area) who are in town this week for <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE">POSSE</a> (Professors' Open Source Summer Experience), a workshop for learning how to get their students involved contributing to open source projects. (In this case, <a href="http://sugarlabs.org">Sugar</a>, with <a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a> as a dev platform.) </p>
<p>They've been learning to hack Sugar all week, and are in fact in #sugar at this very moment tinkering away on the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Measure">Measure Activity</a>. Their feeds haven't yet been added to Planet Sugar Labs (those requests are still pending), but you can read some of their (great!) reflections so far on <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/Planet">Planet TOS</a>.</p>
<p>So if you have a moment, pop in and say hello to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peter Froehlich (Johns Hopkins) - pgf</li>
<li>Karl Wurst (Worcester State College) - kwurst</li>
<li>Nadimpalli Mahadev (Fitchburg State College) - Mahadev</li>
<li>Kristina Striegnitz (Union College, Schenectady, NY) - kis</li>
<li>Jerry Breecher (Clark University, Worcester MA) - diamond</li>
<li>Mihaela Sabin (University of New Hampshire) - mihaela</li>
<li>Gary Pollice (Worcester Polytechnic Institute) - gpollice</li>
<li>Aparna Mahadev (Worcester State College) - aparna</li>
</ul>
<p>Next week we'll have another - slightly larger - batch from RIT doing the same thing, with myself, Chris Tyler, and Luke Macken focusing more on how to make Fedora a better environment for running/deploying/developing Sugar - if you have any thoughts in this direction, please send comments our way! (Things we've come up with so far: general Python development stuff, liveusb-creator hacks, SVG rendering working strangely in different recent versions of Fedora... we need to turn this into a proper ticket queue. Ideas welcome! What are the little annoyances you always wanted to fix? We'll do our best to take them on.)</p>
