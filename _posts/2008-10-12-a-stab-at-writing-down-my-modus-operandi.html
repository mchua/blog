<p>Fail! Publicly! Spectacularly! Get hurt in ways that you can heal from - you know more when you pick yourself up again.</p>
<p>This isn't saying "hurt yourself, and that making your crash landings have a  <em>point</em> - that you learn - is (1) the only way I really <em>can</em> learn, and (2) the only way I can learn fast enough to keep myself alive when taking future spills, since opportunities to fail - and fail <em>hard</em> - seem only to increase as time goes by, and I will not stop taking them.</p>
