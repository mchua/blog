<p>Prof. Brian Bingham during the MetaOlin Systems Engineering module: "All models are broken."</p>
<p>Then later that night, Eric Munsing lent me a copy of Thich Nhat Hanh's book <span style="font-style: italic;">Being Peace</span>, and I read the following (from the precepts of the Buddhist order Nhat Hanh belongs to):</p>
<blockquote><p>First: Do not be idolatrous about or bound to any doctrine, theory, or ideology, even Buddhist ones. All systems of thought are guiding means; they are not absolute truth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Made me smile.</p>
