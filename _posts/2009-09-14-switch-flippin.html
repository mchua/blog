<p>In approximately 7.5 hours, the switch will flip and I will <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Category:Community_Architecture">No Longer Be An Intern</a>. (For the past two weeks - as I've said many, many times before - my mind's been totally amped up with a happy whisper in the background of <i>I-get-to-stay-</i><i>Igettostay</i><i>Igettostay</i><i>Igettostay!</i>) This post brought to you by the Department of Enthusiasm. :-)</p>
<p>In the meantime, I've got a <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FWN/Beats">FWN beat</a> to sub in for and a <a href="http://mchua.fedorapeople.org/sketches/fudcon-toronto-ad.png">FUDCon ad</a> to upload to Design's space and 6 hours of sleep to get (why did I agree to this, Andrew? WHY?)</p>
<p>Today I was a bit hungrier than usual. We were out at the Tacoma Folk Festival, which had all sorts of festival-esque food vendors. For lunch, I downed...
<ul>
<li>a sweet Polish sausage large enough that I had to use both hands to hold/support/eat it</li>
<li>a large raw vegan plate - cracked wheat, seaweed salad, nut... pulse? something with nuts... another sort of salad, and lemonade</li>
<li>a vegetarian pakistani plate piled with rice, spinach, potatoes, and chickpeas stewed in tomato sauce</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, that would be three lunches. After I finished the third lunch, I went to the airport, decided I was <i>still</i> hungry, and inhaled a 1-lb Fuddruckers burger and some sweet potato fries. Disappointingly, it was an airport chain Fuddruckers, so this meant two 1/2-lb patties slammed together instead of the glorious <i>one full pound of lovely juicy not-from-the-freezer beef</i> I've gotten at Real Fuddruckers Locations. So. Four lunches? Three lunches and a dinner? Two lunches and a very large snack and an early dinner? In any case, it was a lot of food. I'm pretty good for not being hungry now (although I'm not particularly full).</p>
<p>...yes, today was my "I'm not a vegan" day. On the whole, I find vegetarianism to be a great thing and not too much effort to keep up (really, I'm almost vegetarian anyway, so being just a <i>little</i> more conscious about it isn't hard) except for special occasions and special treats (like Polish sausage!) but being vegan is supremely inconvenient when I'm not cooking for myself.</p>
<p>Bedtime. Tomorrow is a big day.</p>
