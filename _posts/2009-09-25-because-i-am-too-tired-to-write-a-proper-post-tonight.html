<p>...here is it's marked (and swag-ified) as a LoCo table; we were all there for open source goodness in general - Ubuntu community members explaining to passers-by how the XO runs Fedora right next to the Fedora community member (me) teaching people how to boot their Ubuntu LiveCD. Good times. Any DC-area Fedora Ambassadors want to join them next year? ;-)</p>
<p><em>Edit: Mackenzie points out that "Ubuntu community member" is the appropriate term to use - thanks for the patch (and the awareness)!</em></p>
