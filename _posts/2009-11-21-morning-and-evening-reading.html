<p>Sometimes I like to start my day by reading things. Sometimes I like to end my day by reading things. Sometimes I randomly start taking notes and post them.</p>
<p>Going through Scott Radvan's <a href="http://sradvan.fedorapeople.org/Wireless_Guide/en-US/html-single/">Wireless Guide draft</a> for Fedora 12 was a nice way to start the morning - it does a good job of bringing together a lot of previously scattered information into a coherent whole that mere mortals such as myself can actually make sense of.</p>
<p>If I ever settle down, I'd like to think that, in addition to pets, a piano, books, a garden with foodness (or access to one, since I harbor no delusions about the utter non-greenness of my thumb) my bedroom could eventually look <a href="http://accidentalmysteries.blogspot.com/2009/11/sleep-in-trees.html">something like this</a>. (Via Skud, from IRC.)</p>
<p>Tyler's fault: Seeing photographs of the children of your high school classmates is <em>really weird</em>. (They're incredibly cute, though!)</p>
<p>Tangentially via Brian: <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology">Epistemology</a> is one of those topics I always thought I should read more about, so I went and did that today, and so that'll just percolate in my brain for a while too... (I think it was Tim who described testing to me as "applied epistemology" last year - that definition made me stop and think.)</p>
<p>Toshio had a <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/badger/diary/84.html">fantastic deconstruction</a> of a sample "how I got started in Fedora" case study (which he made up for the purpose of that exercise). I think that kind of analysis is needed more, and will be passing it on as a "look, ain't this cool?" example to some ethnographically-minded folks who might be interested.</p>
<p>Via my brother: an adorable marriage proposal that was an actual item on dealnews.com tonight.</p>

<p>While trying to sort through my current thoughts on "openness" (yep, broad term) I looked to see if I'd braindumped on it before, <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2008/04/05/on-openness-and-privacy/">and I had</a> - it's still an essay draft waiting to be picked apart and rewritten and done <em>well</em>, but Sam's comment is something I wanted to toss out for reflection again.</p>
<blockquote><p>The opposite of openness is not privacy, but isolation.</p></blockquote>
<p>I've got another author to read: Jerry Weinberg. Thanks to <a href="http://www.nehrlich.com/blog/2009/11/10/jerry-weinberg/">Eric Nehrlich</a> for making me aware of Jerry's work - although the post in which he did is both a tribute and a sad one.</p>
<p>Quixotess <a href="http://reconciliate.wordpress.com/2009/10/29/transcription-because-you-do-too-much/">offers to transcribe videos for accessibility</a> - I've left my thanks in a comment, but it basically boils down to "wow, you offered this <em>before we asked?</em> That makes a <em>huge</em> difference! Thank you!" Now, if there are any thought-provoking videos you've ever wanted me to see (and possibly write profusely on ;-) but I couldn't understand before... (Actually, Quixotess makes me wonder whether I could offer something similar - surely my crazy typing speed must be good for <em>something</em>, right? But I can't hear, so I can't transcribe audio or video... maybe I could transcribe photos of whiteboards or somesuch?)</p>
<p>(This also reminds me that I should talk with my alma maters while I'm in town about <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2009/09/29/help-me-design-a-scholarship-or-two/">that scholarship</a>.)</p>
<p>And then I visited the library, so now I have dead trees to read as well. Hurrah!</p>
