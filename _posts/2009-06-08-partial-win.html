<p>I'm actually pretty happy with what I was able to accomplish tonight, given that I spent just a few hours on all this. (Note to self: get cleaning duties out of the way early in the week so you don't keep getting distracted by them.) Hyperfocusing occasionally leads to efficiency.
<ul>
<li><strike>Piano reflections from last week blogged</strike> (<a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2009/06/07/scripting-my-piano-routine/">with video, </a>too.)</li>
<li><strike>Piano practice routine for this week written out</strike></li>
<li><strike>My Fedora todo list is updated</strike> (<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Mchua">here it is!</a>) <strike>and all projects on it have moved one step forward (at least) - </strike><strike>in particular, my Edu SIG tasks should be all done.</strike> (<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Education/Meetings#Agenda_.26_Tasks">Yes, they are!</a> I revamped the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Education">SIG page</a>, started a <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Education/Spin">spin roadmap</a>, and think Sebastian totally rocks.)<strike><br /></strike></li>
<li><strike>All my computers at pika have an internet connection</strike> (Cables, power strip acquired; contractors not done working with house so we don't have outlets in our room yet. But I've gone as far as I can go.)</li>
<li><strike>My Sugar Labs todo list is updated.</strike> (<a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/User:Mchua#Current_goals_and_projects">Here's the list</a> - and I <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2009/06/07/looking-for-things-to-dolooking-for-things-to-do/">called people to help.</a>)</li>
<li><strike>The living room is clean</strike> (Cleaned kitchen instead; living room deferred to tomorrow on account of Vacuum Is Loud And People Are Sleeping Now.)</li>
<li><strike>My parents have been called and appeased with the information that I am, in fact, still alive and well.</strike> (Emailed. Good enough.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I did not do:</p>
<ul>
<li>All POSSE stuff updated to the point where I can do no more until people reply. (Some of it has. Not all. Oh well. I wake up soon.)</li>
<li>My May finances have been totaled up (Uh... yes. I need to retrieve some paperwork from various not-at-pika drawers. I also fully recognize I am procrastinating on this because I <i>hate doing finances</i>. I wonder if there is a way to make myself like it, or at least dislike it less.)</li>
<li>RapidSMS checkup, group and individual updates (This is what tomorrow's bus ride is for.)</li>
<li>At least one of my inboxes is at zero. (Must figure out a realistic goal for this. I haven't found that balance yet, but it's coming.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I didn't plan on doing, but did anyway:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helped out with a product design / humor ideation study, which was interesting</li>
<li>Chilled with cousins, including pancakes, passport photos, and making sure Melanie and her friend got on the right train to the Commons</li>
<li>Impromptu jam session with saxophone</li>
<li>Read two books while waiting for various things to happen.</li>
<li>Did not kill my wrists! (Rubbing them out during breaks and taking long breaks is, I think, a healthy thing.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Matt and I also hooked up the projector in our room and celebrated with a viewing of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5jmgHahnG0">Om Shanti Om</a>. I am not sure how Matt came to be obsessed with this musical number, but okay.</p>
<p>Discovered unexpected benefit of cleaning murph; extra books make fantastic monitor levelers. The Mac is sitting on two dictionaries (Webster and Random House). The Fedora-riffic Thinkpad is perched atop a couple French books, a probability text, and <i>Our Bodies, Ourselves</i>. The HP Vista box has <i>Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering</i>, <i>Metabolic Engineering</i>, and <i>The Intelligent Investor</i>. I use the Thinkpad maybe 95% of the time right now. I'm thinking of interesting cross-platform stuff to do across all three machines.</p>
