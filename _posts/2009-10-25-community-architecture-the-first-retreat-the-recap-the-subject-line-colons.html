<p>A momentous occasion occurred last week: Max, Greg, Karsten, and I were all in the same room at the same time. <i>For four consecutive days. </i>Usually getting us all in the same timezone is already an impossible accomplishment. However, for the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Community_Architecture">Community Architecture</a> retreat, the heavens move. What follows is a Mel's-eye-view.</p>
<p><b>Sunday October 11</b>
<ul>
<li>5:25am flight. Yay.</li>
<li>Rental cars are much cheaper when Karsten drives! (I am going to have such a big celebration on my 25th birthday when we no longer have to pay Young Driver fees.)</li>
<li>Wow, Raleigh has beaches. Also: spicy pineapple marmalade is one of those things that sounds weird, but tastes fantastic.</li>
<li>Want North Carolina BBQ.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Monday October 12</b>
<ul>
<li>What is this "community" thing that we do, and how does it fit into Red Hat? How can we set a good example - and do even more active outreach around that example? We need to do more work on the notion of a "community health dashboard" and articulate the difference between goals and assists - there's a difference between "we did it," "it wouldn't<br />have happened without us," and "it may have happened anyway, but we helped."</li>
<li>Paul Frields drives down from VA to join us! Planning for Fedora 12 filming later in the week ensues, a fascinating process to me because I've never heard this type of conversation  from the other side of the camera before (I was an A/V workstudy in high school).</li>
<li>Education - what's happening in this space? Answer: <a href="http://teachingopensource.org">teachingopensource.org</a> (particularly work on the <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/Textbook_Project">textbook</a>) and <a href="http://hfoss.org">hfoss.org</a> (particularly a working group designing a certificate program) and a strong focus on post-secondary education because that's where there's space to move right now; we only have bandwidth to amplify and connect the K12 activity we come across for now - there are others doing fantastic work in the K12 space.</li>
<li><a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE">POSSE</a> - the upcoming <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_APAC">POSSE APAC</a> and how POSSE will <i>totally</i> kick ass as it expands around the world. (Okay, I'm biased, this was my section.)</li>
<li>Large amounts of grilled fish for dinner. Mmm. And shrimp. And mussels. Still waiting for North Carolina BBQ.</li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br /><b>Tuesday October 13</b>
<ul>
<li>Summer of Code session: Karsten lays out Fedora's performance and progress (<i>very</i> good) and whether we should continue (oh yes).</li>
<li>Fedora marketing: Mel explains the challenges (biggest blocker: lack of capacity and domain expertise) and triumphs (Fedora Insight coming out!) so far. Making the production of marketing deliverables into an easy, regular thing by building a library of examples, HOWTOs, and good tools will give us breathing room to be able to think more strategically for the F13 cycle.</li>
<li>FUDCon Toronto update: it's going to rock.</li>
<li>A general "what's up in Fedora?" update all-around, because the flood of public mailing lists is impossible for any one person to read, and everyone's got different bits they have been watching.</li>
<li>Exodus to bar. Discovery of <i>multiple types</i> of chocolate beer (via mpdehaan's beverage choices); awe.</li>
<li>Still waiting for North Carolina BBQ.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><br />Wednesday October 14</b>
<ul>
<li>How <i>do</i> we do that dashboard we've been thinking about for so long?</li>
<li>Watch Carolina Hurricanes get clobbered by Pittsburgh Penguins in an extended shootout. Watching hockey is <i>fun!</i> It's the first time for both me and Karsten; Max and Greg share season passes. Everybody yells a lot. (Voices are noticeably scratchier the next morning.)</li>
<li>Still waiting for North Carolina BBQ.</li>
</ul>
<p>The team, at hockey. I'm not in the shot because I'm crammed into the corner taking the picture, but there <i>is</i> a Mel in the shot that isn't me; bonus points for whoever can explain, and mega bonus points for up-close pictorial evidence on why Greg's jacket in this picture is hilarious. Also: I think I may have either the shortest - if not, second shortest - hair on the team, despite being the only female; I do know from pictures that everyone else on the team has had, at some point, longer hair than I have <i>ever</i> had in my entire life. This is the only picture I took that week that wasn't of a whiteboard filled with notes.<br /><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="http://blog.melchua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/commarch-at-hockey.png" height="358" width="478" /></p>
<p><b>Thursday October 15</b>
<ul>
<li>Wrap up, set priorities</li>
<li>Wow, we're traveling a lot between now and 2010. (Everyone else: "Awww." Me: "AWWW YEAH!")</li>
<li>NORTH CAROLINA BBQ!</li>
<li>...followed by terrible weather in Atlanta that strands Karsten in GA and causes me to ditch my plane ride for a rental car and a 285mi drive north in the middle of the night; Karsten and I eventually get home.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><br />Friday October 15<br /></b>
<ul>
<li>I miss North Carolina BBQ.</li>
<li>I am spending the summer in Raleigh. PIGS, FEAR ME!</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Quotes of the week:<br /></b><br />Greg: We do not have fixed resources. We have variable resources of unknown quantity until we go and do this:<br />Greg: ping!<br />Greg: ping!<br />Greg: ping!<br />Greg: ping!<br />Greg (shouting, standing up, waving arms frantically) GO GO GO GO GO BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!</p>
<p>Karsten (to Max): You worry too much. But keep doing it.</p>
<p>Somebody, I Forget Who: Community is not a magic wand. It will force-multiply on what already exists.</p>
<p>CommArch, shortly before hockey game starts: Oh no, Mel <a href="http://twitpic.com/ljo73">found a book!</a></p>
