<p>I'm a bit disappointed with myself this week. I...
<ol>
<li>enthusiastically overdid the typing, causing my hands to flare up for two days</li>
<li>ate junk food unconsciously because I was with friends, and felt bleargh afterwards</li>
<li>spent too much money on aforementioned food</li>
<li>crashed my bike and busted a tube</li>
<li>got distracted by a social life in unplanned ways</li>
<li>piled too many small tasks on without breathing or prioritising them</li>
<li>didn't track all my work</li>
</ol>
<p>On the other hand, I...
<ol>
<li>adjusted to the flare-up by scaling back computer use and finding non-typing ways to work on my projects (reading, talking with people, learning context/history)</li>
<li>realized the junk food thing and fixed it</li>
<li>ibid</li>
<li>controlled the crash and matter-of-factly continued on, sans whining</li>
<li>had a social life, and got to spend two evenings with family before they left for China, and was useful there</li>
<li>can fix that now</li>
<li>got a lot more done than I probably realize</li>
</ol>
<p>This coming week, I ought to...
<ol>
<li>religiously rest and treat my arms</li>
<li>try to be as vegan as possible on the road (I know I won't be, but limiting myself to one heavy or non-vegan meal a day and ruling out caffeine and soda ought to help) and see if this keeps me more steadily going in the midst of trave</li>
<li>not. spend. money.</li>
<li>fix my bike</li>
<li>leave space for hanging out with people, which I will want to do (meeting Luke IRL for the first time, yay!)</li>
<li>breathe and prioritize tasks before the week begins, and every evening before sleeping, which includes <i>dropping things I can't do</i> rather than just adding to the pile.</li>
<li>track everything in my notebook, and upload that notebook to The Interwebs each night.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before I hit the plane tomorrow, I should...
<ol>
<li>pack - being sure to put in books and RSI stuff, and plenty of camera memory</li>
<li>print my trip agenda (tickets, boarding passes, contact #s, addresses...)</li>
<li>ensure my NECC buddies know my trip agenda (particularly folks I'm riding or crashing with)</li>
<li>vacuum the murph (my house duty this week)</li>
<li>make sure the sink (my room) has a navigable floor so Matt (my roommate) won't kill me</li>
<li>return or re</li>
</ol>
<p>And it would be really nice, but <i>totally</i> nonmandatory, if I could, before I left...
<ol>
<li>download Greg's textbook outline</li>
<li>download the intern script for revising on the plane</li>
<li>backup to git</li>
<li>upgrade to f11 (yeah, I know... I've been slacking on the backup)</li>
<li>set up offlineimap with thunderbird (alpine can come later)</li>
<li>set up smw for jlaska</li>
</ol>
<p>En route, I should...
<ol>
<li>revise the intern script</li>
<li>read and comment on Greg's textbook outline</li>
<li>prepare a "what is POSSE?"elevator pitch</li>
<li>prepare a "what is RH doing in education?" elevator pitch</li>
<li>prepare the short list of questions I will interview people about</li>
<li>make sure I have a prioritized list of projects</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon reaching the internet that evening, I should...
<ol>
<li>upload all work from airplane</li>
<li>chillax with Mike Lee &amp; family and Sugar Labs DC folk</li>
<li>sleep</li>
</ol>
