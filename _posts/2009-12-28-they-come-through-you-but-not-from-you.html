<p>I'd heard this part of the <a href="http://www.katsandogz.com/onchildren.html">Kahlil Gibran quote on children</a> before:</p>
<blockquote><p>You are the bows from which your children<br />
as living arrows are sent forth.</p></blockquote>
<p>But I'd never seen the rest of it until tonight.</p>
<blockquote><p>Your children are not your children...<br />
They come through you but not from you, <br />
And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I'm thinking about the settling-down and getting-married and having-children thing again (and yeah, it's getting old; it's been old for me for years now). This is somewhat inevitable during any trip involving family, because it's one of those things that's constantly asked about and after a while it starts to get to you. I've always needed to have good answers for why I show no signs of going down that path anytime soon. Marginally acceptable answers (none untrue):</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm just starting out, and I'm so busy with work and travel right now, you know...</li>
<li>I want to finish grad school first. (I never really cared about the "but who will want a woman with more education than himself?" argument - and there's precedent on my mom's side of the family, so I'll deal. My grandmother may despair that I'm making it difficult to find a mate; I'm trying to reframe this as "high standards are a good thing, right?" The problem is that some of our standards may be directly incompatible; for instance, I don't actually give anyone bonus points for being Chinese.)</li>
<li>Hey look, it's $name_of_unmarried_cousin over there - why not start with them? *vanish!* (BEST TACTIC EVAR.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Actual answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>No, I do not feel a deep and lonely void that can only be filled in this manner. I'm happily single, thank you.</li>
<li>The guys my family would set me up with are probably not the kind I'd go for.</li>
<li>And vice versa. And I don't want that fight right now.</li>
<li>"While I recognize that it would make you extremely happy to see my children, <em>your</em> happiness is nowhere near sufficient reason for me to take on the responsibility of acquiring a suitable life-mate, then bearing and raising progeny, likely sacrificing much of my potential to do great things in a career I dearly love in the process." (see Mel Sounds Like A Jerk Alert, below.)</li>
<li>And if I did ever have kids... well, there's a reason <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NbEzTAZT4">Cat's in the Cradle</a> is a song that haunts me whenever I hear it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know I sound like a total jerk when I even write this, but... argh. Sometimes I'm just frustrated and I'd <em>like</em> to say it. And I know it doesn't have to be this way, but it still feels like a <em>giant trap</em>, because there are all these cultural expectations that come with being a wife, and then being a mom, and I have a hard enough time keeping my own stance under <em>just</em> the expectations of being a girl. (To some extent, I <em>will</em> be a girl until/unless I marry.) The ruts of history are so strongly grooved and deeply sloped that once I click into any portion of that track, I'm afraid I won't be strong and steady enough on my feet to keep from being swept down into the rest of it. And I don't think that track goes where I want to go. My mom got married when she was almost exactly a year older than I am today; I'm still young enough that "the rest of my life" is a very long time indeed, at least to me. I admire and envy my friends who are my age and married or engaged or in happy long-term relationships; they have something wonderful that I still don't understand.</p>
<p>The scary thing is that my family (especially my mom's side) is actually pretty liberal and westernized as far as these things go - I know there are a lot of girls who have it way, way worse. (I mean, I went to <em>school</em>. I can read. I'm writing <em>this</em>. That's pretty good already.) Maybe I'm hiding from an invisible shadow that isn't really there - it's hard to tell sometimes. Invisible or not, I think I need to deal with this before I really start the dating thing; I don't want to drag anyone else into carrying that baggage with me. Where I'm from, relationships are between families, not individuals. (What if I end up liking someone who doesn't come from that sort of cultural mentality? That... will be interesting, to say the least.) I have to work on my relationship with my family before I can even think about adding another individual to that mix. And like I said, I don't want that fight right now. I have a lot of other things to do.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think these are all mostly excuses to maintain the paralysis against the pressure until I find someone <em>I</em> like. (Hi, my name is Very Westernized. How are you?) I'll figure out how to deal with all the rest then. I should apologize in advance to any hypothetical future relationships of mine because whoever loves me will continuously have to put up with a lot of shit. (I will, of course, return the favor. That's what it means to love someone.)</p>
<p>In other news, I got a haircut today - there's a good cheap place in the next town that cousin Mark was going to, and my impulsiveness and cheapness won out over the more rationally prudent conflict-avoidance part of my brain. So the shagginess is gone and my hair is now fantastically short, the way I like it (easier to care for). And I did pay for it; I came home and went straight to hug my mom in a pre-emptive mollification move because I knew she wouldn't be pleased. I got away with two relatively short lectures and having to wear earrings and a necklace and a nice blouse (hers, as usual) for dinner. But I'm the one waking up with this haircut for the next couple of months, and <em>I</em> like it. So that's okay.</p>
