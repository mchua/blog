_While roaming through the internet (as one does), I came across a YouTube video of a first-year engineering college class's flash mob titled "One Test More." Of course, it wasn't captioned, so I couldn't figure out the lyrics... but by the time one of my (hearing) colleagues assured me they weren't particularly memorable, I was already halfway through coming up with my own (because that's how I decompress from a long day of videoconferencing, apparently).

I do not pretend that these lyrics are spectacular in the slightest, but if you should ever want to use them to surprise your class, here they are in all theier open-licensed remixable glory. Set to "One Day More" from Les Miserables; it is suggested that the instructor sing Javert's part._

VALJEAN:
One test more
Another day, another destiny
This never-ending road to my degree
This test that I have been assigned
To do in the allotted time
One test more

MARIUS:
I did not sleep before today
Anxiety has not departed

VALJEAN:
One test more

MARIUS & COSETTE:
I have been studying all day
I haven’t slept since finals started

EPONINE:
One more test all on my own

MARIUS & COSETTE:
Will we ever sleep again?

EPONINE:
I just got this, and I’m staring

MARIUS & COSETTE:
I’ve been studying with you

EPONINE:
All the answers I have known

MARIUS & COSETTE:
And I hope my answer’s true

EPONINE:
Have just flown into the air

ENJOLRAS:
One more test upon this form 

MARIUS:
Do I follow where this goes?

ENJOLRAS:
I can almost taste the freedom

MARIUS:
Does this variable go there?

ENJOLRAS:
Then I have to clean my dorm

MARIUS:
Think I have it - do I dare?

ENJOLRAS:
Will you take your place with me?

ALL:
The time is now, the day is here

VALJEAN:
One test more

JAVERT:
Testing at this institution
Helps us rigorously sort
We'll be ready for the ranks of
US News and World Report

VALJEAN:
One test more

M. & MME. THENARDIER:
Watch 'em run amuck
Watch 'em as they fall
Never know your luck
Is there a curve at all
Here's a little 'dip'
There a little 'touch'
Proctors aren’t watching
So they won't catch much

STUDENTS (2 Groups):
1: One day to a new beginning

2: Raise the flag of freedom high

1: Everyone will stand and sing

2: Everyone will stand and sing

1: There's degrees here for the winning

2: There's a new world to be won

ALL:
Do you hear the school bell ring?

MARIUS (to ENJOLRAS):
My test is done, I’ll clean with you

VALJEAN:
One day more

MARIUS & COSETTE:
I did not sleep before today

EPONINE:
One more test all on my own

MARIUS & COSETTE:
Anxiety has not departed

JAVERT (overlapping):
We will score these scantron bubbles
We will follow where they go
We will spot conceptual troubles
We will know the things they know

VALJEAN:
One test more

MARIUS & COSETTE:
I have been studying all day

EPONINE:
All the answers I have known

MARIUS & COSETTE:
I haven’t slept since finals started

JAVERT (overlapping):
Testing at this institution
Helps us rigorously sort
We'll be ready for the ranks of
US News and World Report

THENARDIERS (overlapping):
Watch 'em run amuck
Watch 'em as they fall
Never know your luck
Is there a curve at all

VALJEAN:
Tomorrow we'll be far away
Tomorrow, grades and judgement day

ALL:
Tomorrow we'll discover
Who has gotten through a passing score
One more dawn
One more day
One test more
