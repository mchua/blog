<p>I've been kicking this idea around for a little bit. Here's the problem: I like to travel light, I like to make music, and I play the piano. Solution: Learn guitar. However an ordinary guitar is on the large side, on the loud side, and not headphone-able for my suitemates' sanity. Travel guitars are expensive.</p>
<p>But what if I got <a href="http://www.wholenote.com/store/product.asp?sku=EM.11GBPC">this </a>Martin backpacker steel string guitar? And then followed this Instructables <a href="http://www.instructables.com/ex/i/B5DBF79C006F102980EC001143E7E506/?ALLSTEPS">tutorial</a> to slap a disassembled piezo buzzer into the body as a cheap (yet supposedly still decent) pickup, leading to something like <a href="http://www.wholenote.com/store/product.asp?sku=EM.11GBPC2">this </a>Martin backpacker electric-acoustic, except that slapping in my own pickup wouldn't cost an extra $100. Use the money I saved to pick up a cheap amp.</p>
<p>Then if I have extra time and money, perhaps add in this <a href="http://www.apogeekits.com/guitar_preamp.htm">kit </a>which is a preamp with headphone output for $37. Or machine little attachable "wings" to fill out the Martin into a guitar that can actually sit on my lap, rather like <a href="http://www.wholenote.com/store/product.asp?sku=EM.AS-100C-SPL-MH">this </a>Aria Sinsonido travel guitar.</p>
<p>Essentially, for $50 worth of electronics and random material, transform a $160 Martin into a $340 Aria. The only thing I need to decide is whether I'll actually play it if I build it. No sense in building a guitar I'll play for a month and then abandon. I'm terrible at figuring out what I'm going to follow through on, which is making me more cautious now of what I say I'm going to do.</p>
