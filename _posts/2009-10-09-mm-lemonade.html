<p><a href="http://geekfeminism.org/2009/10/08/psa-mikeeusas-hate-speech-and-harassment">Shit happens sometimes.</a> It's a risk we take,   one we can mitigate but ultimately not avoid. And when a community comes together and collectively creates a safe environment that turns a small crappy experience into a reaffirming message of support and solitude and participation in active countermeasures, then <a href="http://geekfeminism.org/2009/10/08/psa-mikeeusas-hate-speech-and-harassment/#comment-1679">that's the kind of world you want to live in.</a></p>
<p>I'm tired right now (landed back in DC a few hours ago and it's now 4am) but hope to be less cryptic about this later, but suffice it to say that the folks at <a href="http://geekfeminism.org">geekfeminism.org</a> have been - and are - a real inspiration. A special thanks to Skud and Mackenzie for writing what they did.</p>
<p>Ok. Submitting a talk proposal, checking a package, going to bed; the rest of my to-do list can wait until tomorrow.</p>
