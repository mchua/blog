<p>I've decided that my contribution to the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:Tempe_2011_Sessions#Hackfests">FUDCon Tempe Hackfests</a> will be to roam around interviewing/photographing/liveblogging progress and helping teams clean up their wiki pages so that my liveblogs of their progress will make sense.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.melchua.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/liveblogging-the-hackfests.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2745" title="liveblogging-the-hackfests" src="http://blog.melchua.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/liveblogging-the-hackfests.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="413" /></a></p>
<p>My goal here is to <strong>tackle external communications so hackfests can focus on hacking.</strong> If you're a hackfest owner (or just attending, even), any advance info you can give me (or better yet, your hackfest's wiki page) about goals and whatnot will help; the more I know about what you're doing, the better I'll be able to cover you.</p>
<p>Want to join me? Need to find me to sync up beforehand or  call me in  during the festivities? I'm <strong>mchua</strong> on IRC and will be  hanging out  in <strong>#fedora-fudcon</strong>. Look for a flood of posts on Planet once the hackfests begin.</p>
