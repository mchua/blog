<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Woke up this morning to find the Jam in the <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/personaltech/articles/2007/06/09/let_the_games_begin/">Boston Globe</a>. One thing I'm learning: I was a very slow-paced reporter. I like to get to know my interview subjects and ask them what they'd like to share,   but being interviewed for this one was like <i>WHAM! </i>Call me asap. <i>WHAM! </i>Busy, call back. <i>WHAM! </i>Question question question thank you <i>DONE</i>. The other reporters took more time, but I'm still reeling from how <i>fast</i> they go. Maybe I'm more of an anthropologist than a journalist; people are a lot more than sources of information. Also got interviewed (on-camera this time) this afternoon so we'll see how that goes.</p>
<p>We have... working... games. They're demoing at the midway check-in right now, and we've got a memory game, an Incredible-Machine-like physics simulation, an Abalone board, a flower breeding game, Reversi... and the games that were working last night (along with more that are very, very close to playable). (3D-pong just got a rousing round of applause - the levels have different-shaped paddles, gravity going down, sideways...)</p>
<p>Lunch was an adventure. Yifan, Bryce, Jessi, Boris, and I sliced and diced our way through obscene amounts of lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and bell peppers - and even more obscene amounts of bread - to make sandwiches to feed a small army, wrapping them in loads of paper towels (with scrawled marker letters indicating which ones were sundried-tomato-beef-cheese-onion and which were honey-mustard-ham-lettuce-pepper-mayo or whatever other permutation we could find), wrapped those in clean garbage bags, and trundled them in a rickety cart through three buildings, an elevator, and rain... and rain... and rain. When Yifan and Boris began unwrapping the sandwiches, there was a collective murmur of "ohmigod" at the sheer volume. We had perhaps 10 cubic feet of sandwich. Probably more. Dinner involved the largest pot of spaghetti I have ever cooked, along with the realization that with said spaghetti one could feed an entire conference for a little over $1 a head.</p>
<p>Judging tomorrow. Whee!</div>
