<p>Dr. William Kelly, Director of External Affairs for <a href="http://asee.org">ASEE</a>, visited Purdue today and asked for thoughts on the <a href="http://www.abet.org/accreditation-criteria-policies-documents/">ABET accreditation criteria</a>. Here are my notes and questions to him after a couple hours of conversation.</p>
<p><strong>How can we get the criteria to encourage creative maxima, not just specify bare minima?</strong> Art schools seem to do this well; everyone's trying to be as creative as possible. If we run with this analogy and think of a studio classroom with individual students, how do we make a good studio classroom for engineering education where the "individual students" are individual engineering programs/institutions?</p>
<p>Engineers are often habituated into viewing everything as an engineering project; if we can read a document as a contractual minimum specification and treat it as a checklist, we will -- <strong>how do we make documents that <em>can't</em> be read as contractual minimum specifications?</strong> (Sometimes it takes a huge kick in the rear to shake us out of habit.)</p>
<p><strong> Beware magic wands.</strong> Social media, open-ended projects, flipped classrooms, MOOCs, etc can all propagate the same old paradigms and not lead to deep learning if they don't matter -- they're tools and potential means, not ends that guarantee success.</p>
<p>There are several ways to create change. One is to mandate what you want to happen. The other is to <strong>make it the easiest way to get things done.</strong></p>
<p>Innovation implies the taking of risks, and that implies occasional failure. What are you doing to allow and reward failure and the public sharing and <strong>promotion of failure as a learning experience to celebrate?</strong></p>
<p>Making room for new things sometimes involves dropping the old. <strong>What old things are programs dropping in order to try new ones</strong>, and how can programs be not-penalized (but even rewarded) for killing off "sacred cows"?</p>
