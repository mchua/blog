<p>Back from Boston/NYC/Glenview/Lafayette/Berea/and onwards. Visiting engineering colleges with Melanie, including the long conversations about everything that come on long drives; swinging through my parents' house and my apartment and Matt's place down in Kentucky once again, and then off she goes to Seattle, and off I fly to Manchester tonight, and a flurry of getting-ready because <a href="http://www.harihareswara.net/sumana/2012/07/24/0">Sumana</a> and I will be hiking across England for approximately the next two weeks and then I'll be in Germany until immediately before school begins...</p>
<p>...all of which goes to say I've accepted that my online life is probably going to be radio silence for a while, and I give myself permission to accept that and be free of it. It's okay if I don't write everything down; I always can, but I don't have to.</p>
<p>I'm checking to see if I can get away with bringing no electronic devices other than my hearing aids. My mom says I should bring my dad's old iPhone to use as a wifi-enabled device that also happens to play music and have a compass; we'll see. I was hoping to do the no-bag hike-across-Europe (with one of those jackets with bajillions of pockets) but a non-broken jacket of the proper size/style did not arrive in time, and my old jacket doesn't have enough pockets, so I'm toting my tiniest backpack, which allows me to bring a 2L camelbak.</p>
<p>But do I get a bandanna and/or flashlight to put in it, now that I've got slightly more room? Also under debate: haircut before I leave? But really, there are bigger fish to fry, more important things to do before I leave, and that's what I should spend the next few hours on -- getting my affairs in order so that when I travel, I feel truly free and unobligated.</p>
<p>I'm off, then.</p>
