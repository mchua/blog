<p>I wasn't very good at being present earlier today. I realized this, and then I fixed it. This makes me happy.</p>
<p>Some good things happened tonight because of things that, earlier, were not so good. I have been told that I'm "depressingly optimistic" in the past. It seems to make me happy,though. Seems, for that matter, to make other people happy sometimes too. I think I'll stick around this way. </p>
<p>I am thankful for the privilege of having <a href="http://robogeek.livejournal.com/62107.html">friends</a> <a href="http://blog.ellenchisa.com/?p=152">who</a> <a href="http://infryq.livejournal.com/264797.html">make</a> <a href="http://gregdek.livejournal.com/39684.html">me</a> <a href="http://dwins.wordpress.com/2008/11/13/the-right-audience/">think</a> <a href="http://brianio.com/skateboarding-almost-hit-by-car/">and</a> <a href="http://www.sububi.org/2008/11/19/radiohead/">laugh</a>, often at the same time. (Links in no particular order.)</p>
<p>Ideas. They're <i>so damn fragile.</i> The world is terrifyingly malleable, and I love it. The way I live my life is built on thousands of fragile assumptions and habits I've stacked together because I had to fit into a sort-of-ordered world, and I could take it all apart so easily, for the right reason. I don't know how to tell what the right reason is. I'm pretty sure that is an indication that I haven't had one yet.</p>
<p>I need to not burn out. I'm going to bed. I'm learning how to rest.</p>
