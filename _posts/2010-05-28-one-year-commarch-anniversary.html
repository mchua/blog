<p>I've been at <a href="http://redhat.com">Red Hat</a> for a year - May 28th was my first official full day of work as a <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Community_Architecture">CommArch</a> intern. And I'm still as happy about it now as I <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2009/05/28/signs-you-may-have-found-your-calling/">was back then.</a> Happier and more excited, if anything,   now that I'm getting to know how things work and see more of the potential for all the crazy awesome that lies ahead. Never thought I'd actually want to stay in a place this long, and think about staying even longer. But then again, life can surprise you sometimes.</p>
<p>Thanks to my team - Max and Karsten, and of course Greg, plus the extended CommArch family - for a wonderful year.</p>
