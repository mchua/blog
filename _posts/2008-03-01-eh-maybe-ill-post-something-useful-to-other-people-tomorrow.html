<p>I probably need an "essays" stream for things that are more relevant to people-who-aren't-me, so others can choose to not be subjected to this babble - although this blog is written for myself, I occasionally pop out random thoughts that I think are more worth reading than the rest. I must ponder the question of personal website ontology and information architecture at some point (in my copious amounts of free time).</p>
