<p>And on a happier note, I'm starting to reliably be able to quell the warning signs of impending RSI-related pain. Hurrah for self-massage tools and trigger point workbooks!</p>
<p>Folks, try this: take your hand and grab the opposite arm below the elbow (on the side of your elbow closer to your wrist than your shoulder) and deeply press into the right and left sides of your forearm. Tense? 30 seconds of deep, short strokes in one direction. Other side, then other arm. Repeat hourly.</p>
<p>Hurts like hell, but hurts <i>preemptively</i> like hell instead of flaring up mid-sentence. Much preferred.</p>
