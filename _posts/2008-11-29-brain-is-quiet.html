<p>I started the last post before leaving for the party; I'm back now, and my hair's as long as it was yesterday. Hair cutting places close earlier than I'd expected.</p>
<p>My brain's oddly quiet. I'm not sleepy or physically exhausted, but I'm tired somehow. Something invisible went <i>shoop!</i> up inside me sometime this afternoon - probably in the library, but I didn't notice until I walked into the mass of people at Berkman^2 and felt like being very still, and very quiet, and sort of nonverbally interactive*. Towards the end, Hanna got me sparked up talking about engineering education. (Thanks, Hanna.) Some things will drag me into enthusiasm no matter what. It's probably the best way I have of identifying my actual calling(s) in life, since I usually get excited about <i>everything</i> and excitement is easily mistaken for deep passion.</p>
<p>*Sign language is especially handy for times like this.</p>
<p>I'm lucky to have friends who'll make me interactive despite myself. I got eaten by a giant whiteboard amoeba and did some area calculations for the missile silo. Worked out an a capella arrangement on the train. I've got to find a way to sketch them out on paper now that I haven't got Sibelius. <a href="http://lilypond.org/web/">Lilypond</a>? I'm not good enough at it yet to make the process non-laborious. (I would say the same for emacs.) I should probably invest the time and learn.</p>
<p>For the most part, though, a tiny clear voice is the only thing singing through my head. That's mostly metaphorical, but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RthZgszykLs">not entirely</a>. That's why I came up with the a capella arrangement (SSAA); it's a good way to get a song unstuck. It also reminds me that vocal percussion is on my to-learn list. (Oddly enough, I can let that thought go calmly, without feeling the need to get really excited and chase that thought down. See? <i>Weird.</i>)</p>
<p>It's odd and rare for my mind to be so still. It often means I'm sick, but I don't think this is the case now. At the very least, it means I have something to think about that I haven't yet realized I have to think about. The best thing to do in these cases is usually for me to go to sleep.</p>
<p>I used to have a sketch in the back of my old notebook this summer indicating that I was "too tired to ask for hug." (It doesn't do any good right now because I don't have that notebook, and I'm the only one in this apartment.) Years ago I found that leaning my head against something temporarily - wall, window, furniture - is a passable substitute that doesn't require the presence of another human being, and lets me have a single point of physical contact (which I'm very conscious of) to focus my brain on, so there would be something <i>there</i> for it to <i>stay</i> on without pumping up the adrenaline. (I kinda wonder if a hat would do the same thing, if I didn't wear it all the time but put it on when I needed to be conscious about focusing a bit.) Stretching works as well, but is less easy to do in public.</p>
<p>My mind is still operating sans its usual --verbose flag. So I'll stretch out a little, and then I'll go to sleep. It's good to more consciously articulate what I'm learning about the way my brain works.</p>
