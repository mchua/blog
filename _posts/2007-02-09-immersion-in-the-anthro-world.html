<p>I attended my first graduate school class today. It's a qualitative field research methods course in the anthropology department at MIT that I'm auditing (doing all the work and such, the discipline, and being a baby-faced 20-year-old  in a room filled with grad students and postdocs) and I am <span style="font-style: italic;">totally</span> going to get my butt kicked by the workload, but I'm loving it. This afternoon was three straight hours of my brain going "whoa! whoa! paradigm shift!"</p>
<p>As an engineer, I'm used to being a monkey with a hammer trying to affect my universe  instead of a fly on the wall trying to understand it. I am trying to  kick myself into thinking like a scientist (preferably of the social  type),  thinking about observing the world and  trying to figure out why things happen, rather than being of the "Find  Tools Fix Problem" ENGR mindset. I keep on going "where is my toolbelt and  how can I fix this?" but I'm doing my best to not scratch that itch and  instead immerse myself in this new field without shoehorning it into my  usual one (...anthropologizing anthropology, sort of - ironically, I'm  also simultaneously trying to engineer engineering in my other projects,  or at least to engineer engineering education. Mm, meta.)</p>
<p>It's also interesting to hear the (mixed) views of the social  science students on engineers (especially since it's an MIT class and a  bunch of them were formally engineers and some of the other students are  doing some sort of technical work as well). Do we really look down on  the humanities that much? Do we really have that much arrogance in  thinking we can fix the world by objectifying it and treating components   numerically? Do we really, at our worst, ignore the world around us  that we're supposed to be learning to serve with our technical skills? </p>
<p>I've been soaked in a "rah rah engineering is awesome" environment so  much at Olin that the notion that it could be otherwise (to educated,  rational, smart people with valid points looking at decent data) came as  a surprise. I am not quite sure what to do about this yet.</p>
<p>It's going to be quite a ride.</p>
