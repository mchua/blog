<p>I thought this would be a good brainstorming exercise. This is a partial list; as I get used to delegating, it'll get better. (Actually, this blog is a better design notebook than any paper one I've ever had - I just need a way to sketch easily in here...)</p>
<ol>
<li>Get me off mailing lists that just won't unsubscribe me.</li>
<li>Summarize podcasts and YouTube videos with spoken words that I can't understand (read:Â  nearly all of them)</li>
<li>Call for product information / warranties (for instance, my drumset's electronics have spazzed out <em>again</em>.)</li>
<li>Email me directions and store hours for local providers of some product that I want to get</li>
<li>Monitor my LinkedIn and Facebook accounts for Critical Mass Of People That I Should Respond To Now</li>
<li>Balance my books (enter these receipts into my system, please)</li>
<li>Schedule appointments (meetings, talks, etc.) and remind me to prepare for them. And booking plane flights and long-haul bus/train tickets. Yay for not dealing with that stuff this summer!</li>
<li>Find teachers for things I want to learn. Books, tutorials, and equipment, too. Like learning scouts!</li>
<li>Evaluate (online) software for me</li>
<li>Wake-up calls</li>
<li>Exercise routine and piano practice inspiration emails ("training reminders"). Actually, hm. This gives me an idea.</li>
<li>Mini-research sprints</li>
<li>Keeping me fed with new information (pushing the books I want to read onto the Hold list for the library, then poking me to pick them up)</li>
<li>Selling things on craigslist, ebay, amazon, etc. for me. Well, listing them, anyway.</li>
<li>Find other, more specialized people for me to outsource bigger jobs to.</li>
</ol>
