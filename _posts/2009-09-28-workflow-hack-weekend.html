<p>I just discovered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs">xargs</a>. With that, I think I've got enough queued up for another workflow hack weekend - haven't had one of those in a while.</p>
<p>On my list of things to do:
<ol>
<li>Install the <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2009/09/16/back-to-irssi/">irssi plugins</a> various people have suggested.</li>
<li>Trick out my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29">vim</a>; go through vimtutor, <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2009/06/23/dig-into-unix-vi/">learn some shortcuts</a>, put in a nice theme, get expansion of fixed text working.</li>
<li>Set up my homedir to pull all its stuff from git checkout. I've been incrementally moving towards having my life in version control for perhaps a year now, and it's been a good practice for me to continue - even if I never reach full VCS-age, it's making me clean up my workflow considerably.</li>
<li>See again about switching from Thunderbird to offlineimap + mutt - I suspect this isn't actually going to happen (despite the awesomeness of vim text expansion) because, the more I think about it, the more I like being able to see my lists of subject lines in a pane alongside the message, and... well... ah, I should try it for a week and see.</li>
<li>List (and centralize, where possible) my ticket queues.</li>
<li>Mess around with xargs and whatever other cool command-line things I can find. I'd like to do GUI-Free-Week again someday, just to see how I fare this time around.</li>
<li>See if I can switch from lettermelater back to a simple crontab with a bunch of mail commands; this is what I used in high school to send my parents letters home every once in a while - autogenerated from one of several default templates - so they wouldn't bug me so much. I <i>think</i> I will have to use offlineimap to make this work. (I'm certainly not running a mail server on my laptop.)</li>
</ol>
<p>That's a pretty decent todo list; not sure what I'll get through, but we shall see.</p>
