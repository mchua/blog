<p>To the current Olin students who've discovered my old blog posts: <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2007/06/05/olin-students-are-slackers/#comments">the comments are even better.</a> Pay particular attention to Kim's note, as at the time her class was the only batch of alumni out in The Real World.</p>
<p>Commenters in order:
<ul>
<li> Nikki Lee '10</li>
<li> Boris Dieseldorff '09</li>
<li> Matt (I don't recall which Matt, but I think this was someone from either '07 or '08)</li>
<li> Mel Chua '07</li>
<li> Kim McCraw '06</li>
<li> Matt (Colyer '07, I think)</li>
<li> Marco Morales '11</li>
<li> Hari Iyer '11</li>
<li>Mel Chua '07</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that "who we are and what Olin stands for" is one of those $sum_{olin=c/o'06}^{olin=c/o'infty}smartness ggg smartness-of-any-individual$ (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_markup">translation key</a> for the non-LaTeX-initiated) things. Thanks to Hari for bringing this up, and to everyone on Thinktank for reminding me of why I love my alma mater; the phoenix is in great hands.</p>
