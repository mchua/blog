<p>Experiment after a conversation with Bernie: The <a href="http://bugs.sugarlabs.org/query?status=accepted&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;order=priority&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;col=milestone&amp;col=component&amp;keywords=%7Edev-love">dev-love keyword</a>, which is a tag for fixes that make the lives of developers easier when applied. These are the tickets with force-multiplying effects and we should tackle those whenever possible - even, I'd argue, over features other than the most critical-path ones (i.e. "does Sugar still work?") It's all about capacity-building.</p>
<p>Now, this keyword is going to die unless it's documented somewhere, and people adopt it - so here's what I'm asking.</p>
<p>If you're a Sugar developer - either Activities or sugar-core - what features, bugfixes, tools, or code hacks would make <i>your</i> life easier? I'm not talking about cool features you'd like to see in Sugar for end-users or what would make it easier for kids (or others) to do Sugar development, although all these things may certainly overlap. I'm asking for things we can do to <i>your</i> Sugar hacking experience a better one. Ticket numbers and links are preferred, but I'll take task descriptions and file/tag them myself if I have to.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bugs.sugarlabs.org/ticket/1366">#1366, easier bug reporting</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bugs.sugarlabs.org/ticket/1442">#1442, Reject activity bundles which require a newer version of Sugar</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bugs.sugarlabs.org/ticket/1842">#1842, Journal does not provide any error message on write errors</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What would make your Sugar hacking easier and more fun?</p>
