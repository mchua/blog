<p>April hasn't been such a great month.</p>
<p>Week 1: Grandfather has heart attack.<br />Week 2: Grandfather's funeral. My first car accident.<br />Week 3: Grandmother's brother passes away.<br />Week 4: LOOK, DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.</p>
<p>Since we're a very tight-knit family, the ripples of these things happening spread far and hit hard. Please, people, no more of this stuff until graduation, okay?</p>
<p>On a lighter note, mental frameworks are possibly our most powerful tools. How wonderful it is to have convenient ways of understanding things! (How uncomfortable to not be able to fit into the frameworks you hold!) How easy it is to slip into categories! How dangerous!</p>
<p>Sometimes mental frameworks that are just slightly off are more dangerous than ones that are completely out of whack. At least the second type tends to get noticed and fixed.</p>
