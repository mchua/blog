<p>My coworkers! Here's a <a href="http://blog.laptop.org/2008/11/14/now-thats-a-great-smile/">picture</a> of (almost) the entire OLPC office.</p>
<p>I'm missing from this picture because I was frantically running the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Community_testing_meetings/2008-11-13">community testing meeting</a> on IRC, about 30 feet to the right of everybody gathered at the whiteboard.</p>
