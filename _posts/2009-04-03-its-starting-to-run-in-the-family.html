<p>My brother Jason has been <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2036038&amp;id=1144170151&amp;l=42fba8433b">bitten by the design bug</a>. After a series of happy <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2026781&amp;id=1144170151&amp;l=73bcb5ac65">adventures in project-based classes</a>, he's decided to declare as an architectural design major at Stanford. I am telling him that training himself in statics and thermo and the usual basic standbys of a MechE degree is also a useful thing to do, though (mechE being the other degree he was considering). He's trying to get to Boston this summer to do some design/engineering work; I hope he makes it so we can get a place together (possibly at pika).</p>
<p>Cool moment: when he described to me on the phone what he wanted to do and I said "actually, there's a name for that... people make their living as experience designers," and there was silence on the other end and then a breathless <em>"really??!!??" </em>Boy, do I know how that kind of moment feels...</p>
<p>Also: a <a href="http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/List_of_Hacker_Spaces">list of hacker spaces</a>, courtesy of Chris. IMSA is going to <a href="http://coolhub.wordpress.com/">start a bunch</a>. I'm looking forward to that.</p>
<p>By the way: limited computer use does, in fact, hurt less. Sweet. Also, homemade blueberry hand pies are awesome (and by extension, Lissa rocks completely, once again).</p>
