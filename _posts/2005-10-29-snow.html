<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">How to have a good Saturday:</p>
<p></span>1. Stay up reading and talking to friends 'till 6.<br />2. Wake up - no alarm - at 10am. Decide blankets are warm. Snuggle back inside bed.<br />3. Wake up - no alarm - at noon. Decide blankets are still warm,   and very comfortable. Re-nap.<br />4. Wake up - no alarm - at 2pm - to big, fat snowflakes drifting slowly down from the sky. Rejoice, take a hot shower, and lounge until you<br />5. Go to dinner at your aunt's house and play with small children.</p>
<p>(to be completed shortly)</p>
<p>6. Returning from dinner, have some good productive work time until<br />7. ExpressO jamming practice with Kristen and Eric, followed by<br />8. More happy productivity that makes a huge dent in your to-do list.<br />9. Hot tea and conversations, then<br />10. More sleep.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><br /></span></p>
