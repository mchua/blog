<p>I never thought this day would come, but I'm... tweeting a conference. That would be <a href="http://twitter.com/mchua">http://twitter.com/mchua</a> with the #necc09 hashtag.</p>
<p>When in Rome, do as Romans do. I need to follow backchannel, since me + speakers too far away to lipread = nonfunctionality, and all updates and highlights will end up on this blog anyhow (so if all you follow is this, you'll get everything) but I've also been told that educators tweeting is a thing of beauty and a joy to behold, and that they are true masters of the medium, so - I'm eager to learn the art, although it's likely that I won't be using it too long.</p>
