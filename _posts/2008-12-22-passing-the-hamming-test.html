<p>Someone asked me what I was passionate about, what I was trying to do, and why I was doing what I was doing, and I was <i>immediately</i> able to give them an answer that I believed in, could think of no way of improving, that I liked, and that I was actively working on.</p>
<p>It means I passed the <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/%7Erobins/YouAndYourResearch.html">Hamming test</a> today. I am proud of this. Rarely before have I felt such a strong conscious alignment between the things I know, the things I'm doing, and the things I should be doing. (It doesn't mean they're easy to do.)</p>
<p>Good times, stirring multiple pots of bubbling curry, stew, frying zucchini, roasting garlic on the stove, and making tea. Full presence in a job that I can do, and finish, and be satisfied by (eating!) at the end. That's something that doesn't fill me up forever... it's far too easy, and a world waits out there to be fed in more ways than my cooking for two can satisfy.</p>
<p>To use a phrase again, though - ...and all the same, I wish it were as simple as this always.</p>
