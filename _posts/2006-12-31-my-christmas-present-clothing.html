<p>My mother has complained about my wardrobe for years; it consists mostly of free t-shirts, and the few scruffy jackets she's been able to get me to wear. Now that I've stopped growing, she wants to give me <a href="http://theimagestudios.com/services.htm">one of these</a> as a Christmas present (belated). I think she's trying to tell me something.</p>
<p>Clothes are things I lump in the same category as grades and money; I wish they didn't matter, grudgingly acknowledge they do matter to many people, and set things up so that I can ignore them as soon as possible. For instance, I get only shirts and pants that match nearly all my other shirts and pants so that when I perform my complicated selection procedure of "pick the shirt at the top of the pile when you get up in the morning," chances are that I won't look too bad. All jeans go with all t-shirts, so this is easy.</p>
<p>Mom's making the compelling argument that if I go suit-shopping with her now, it saves me money (the suit and associated wardrobe will be a graduation-birthday-Christmas present, although I'd much rather have a new laptop, a dremel, or another two years of webhosting)<br />and time (because I won't have to buy a new suit for many years, on account of I'm no longer growing... and because she'll stop nagging me about it). Since a professional wardrobe is one of those things that I'm going to have to do <span style="font-style: italic;">eventually</span> and might as well get over with now, and since it will make my mother happy (and probably my dad's parents, too), I said okay.</p>
<p>So I get to go clothes shopping for a whole new wardrobe this winter break. Yay. I'd much rather be working on math instead...</p>
