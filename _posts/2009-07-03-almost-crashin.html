<p>Both my laptop and my sense of balance decided to flare up on the bus, so I got about 10% of the typing done I thought I would. Now my battery and consciousness-ability are simultaneously running out. I'm getting much better (out of necessity) at queuing up exactly what I need to do at the keyboard when I'm able to be at it. This is a useful skill I never thought I would have to acquire, since I grew up past the age of mainframes.</p>
<p>Sleeping and seeing if that fixes things - I honestly only need another 90-120 minutes of typing to get <i>everything</i> done from today.</p>
