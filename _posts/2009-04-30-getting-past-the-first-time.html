<p>I keep telling myself that the first time through doing some things is going to be awkward no matter what, and the sooner I get the first time over with, the better, because then I can get past the "haven't done this before, what is going on?" stage faster and actually get good at it.</p>
<p>Doesn't make it any easier, but it does motivate me more to plunge in. And whaddya know? I learn things.</p>
