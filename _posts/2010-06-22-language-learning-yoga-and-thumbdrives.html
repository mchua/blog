<p><a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE"></a><a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE">POSSE</a> alumni Kristina Striegnitz and her student Kirk Winans are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system">looking to do some linguistics-learning hacking</a> (tools for language learners) and would love ideas for what to work on; they'd like to put the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system">Leitner system</a> (where the computer tracks your correct/incorrect answers and brings up things you answered incorrectly more frequently in the future) into something fun. Any suggestions? I left mine <a href="http://striegnitz.wordpress.com/2010/06/18/language-learning-activities-for-sugar/#comment-2">here</a> (awaiting comment moderation as I type this).</p>
<p>Olin alumni Janet Tsai wrote a <a href="http://forcesinyoga.com/pa/Forces_in_Yoga.html">proposal</a> for using yoga as a way to explain engineering. I think I need the reverse equivalent - engineering as a way to explain yoga (or running, or whatever) - I have very little physical awareness, but math and physics make things make more sense; I understood dancing much better once folks like Gui and Andrew began to explain what I should do in terms of adjusting spring constants and whatnot. I wonder if I can get someone to teach me some sport - almost any sport,   but bonus points if it's a martial art - with that sort of mentality. Too bad Janet lives in a different state...</p>
<p>Supertalent makes <a href="http://www.supertalent.com/products/stt_usb_detail.php?type=Pico#">little flash drives</a> that would make pretty awesome necklaces. Next time my mom insists I have some form of jewelry for some formal occasion, if given enough advance warning, I might just do that. ("What's that on your necklace?" "Fedora 13. Want to install it on your computer?") I do not like jewelry at all, but I keep on getting bothered to wear it, and figure that having <em>one</em> necklace and <em>one</em> set of earrings and perhaps <em>one</em> bracelet I can tolerate is better than constantly being forced to borrow stuff I don't like. Too bad I didn't get a set of white LED earrings when Alex Wheeler's FBE class made them; they are ridiculously expensive when you get them online. Maybe I'll ask her how to make them if I find out I will need this stuff again.</p>
