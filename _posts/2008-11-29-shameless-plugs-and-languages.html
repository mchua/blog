<p>Matt Barkau's <a href="http://www.olpcnews.com/software/applications/free_icon-to-speech_open-source_speech_for_disabled.html">Free Icon To Speech</a> is one of those projects you just really <i>want</i> to see succeed; it's a communication augmentation Activity for the XO that synthesizes speech in response to icon selections. If you're a new developer looking for some friendly code to play with, Matt's put in a lot of time to make it easy to work with - here's an <a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Ermattb1/freeicontospeech/trunk/annotate/6?file_id=model.py-20080910053520-3hrs033wu1dk92od-2">example</a>. If it looks like the kind of thing you'd like to help with, then check out the project's <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/FreeIconToSpeech">homepage</a> and <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/freeicontospeech">the rest of the code</a>. There's plenty to work on both for <a href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/freeicontospeech">developers</a> and <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/FreeIconToSpeech#Additional_Enhancements_and_Uses">other contributors</a>.</p>
<p>Also, since I don't believe I've plugged this here before: check out <a href="http://planet.sugarlabs.org/">planet.sugarlabs.org</a> if you want to keep up with the thoughts and work of the growing <a href="http://sugarlabs.org/">Sugar Labs</a><a href="http://sugarlabs.org/"> community</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I've been growing slowly more interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language">ASL</a> and deaf culture (as may have been apparent from previous posts, including the ones where I've said things like this before). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language_grammar">grammar</a> is particularly interesting; I'd love to take a class in ASL grammar specifically someday, never having formally studied it. I've taught several friends some of the tiny bits of ASL I know, but it often doesn't <i>look</i> right - we call it their "hearing accent" (I have one too). It's the tiny subtle things you do or don't do when you sign something - facial expressions, <a href="http://www.aslpro.com/mouthmorphemes/mouthmorphemes.html">mouth morphemes</a>, how far or fast your hands move, things like that - I dimly remember enough to tell it looks wrong somehow, but usually don't know enough to figure out how to make it look right again.</p>
<p>I want to live or work with other people who do ASL at some point; I need more frequent practice, and I'm at the point for that language where immersion would actually do me some good. (I'm not <i>quite</i> at that point for any other languages yet, but could probably get my Japanese and Mandarin there fairly quickly if given... say, a month's advance notice of such an opportunity.) When I look through the dictionary, I'm amazed at how quickly my <a href="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/browser.htm">vocabulary</a> reactivates. I've seen a lot of these words before, I just... never signed them back at anyone. I wonder if learning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lan-nang">my family's dialect</a> would feel the same way. It's nearly impossible to find textbooks on that, though.</p>
