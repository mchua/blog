<p>The <a href="http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4081">Record</a> Activity wasn't working in our (testing) image of <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick">SoaS</a>. Fortunately, <a href="http://sdziallas.com">Sebastian</a> was in town and quickly showed <a href="http://melispeaks.wordpress.com/">Melanie</a> how to fix it - it's just a matter of updating to the latest RPM.
<ol>
<li>Switch to root.</li>
<li>Run "yum update --enablerepo=rawhide sugar-record" (no quotes)</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>On a separate note, now that Melanie has picked up on deployment support (I have very little to do with that at this point other than being around for general minionhood - Melanie's my boss for that) I'm starting to (finally) turn my thoughts to testing/QA infrastructure. The Welly crew has been <a href="http://lists.laptop.org/listinfo/testing">keeping the flame alive</a> and I've got quite a bit to learn from them from the year I've been out of the OLPC/Sugar QA loop.</p>
