<p>Oh my good lord. Okay. The next time I find boneless skinless chicken thighs on sale,   I'm doing this again - although I suspect it would work equally well with other chicken bits. Loosely adapted from America's Test Kitchen. I say "loosely" because this is the didn't-measure, don't-have-most-of-the-equipment-you-suggested, wildly-substituting-and-omitting-ingredients grad student kitchen version. Here goes.</p>
<p>Get a big bowl. Mix together some plain yogurt (about 2 cups) with a few heaping spoons of mustard (spicy, with the big mustard seeds unbroken) and sriracha (or, I suppose, the hot sauce of your choice). Throw in some pepper and salt and whatever other random spices you like -- I used some "southwestern spice blend" my mom had given me, but honestly I think the mustard and sriracha are already plenty. I also lopped in a heaping spoon of finely minced garlic, because I had it around.</p>
<p>It will smell fantastic. Get the chicken bits good and covered with the stuff, throw them in a bowl, wrap in plastic, set in the fridge overnight. Or if you're me, get caught up by work and leave 'em there for 2 whole days.</p>
<p>At this point you can take the chicken out and just throw it in a hot oiled skillet and you'll get this amazing, tender, juicy pan-fried chicken. (I did that for two pieces of chicken because I'd run out of oven-safe containers and I was very, very hungry.) But if you want to go ridiculous, crank the oven to 400F and keep going.</p>
<p>Get some crumby-things. I used extra breadcrumbs from the freezer. The original recipe suggests crushed cornflakes. Maybe you could do cornmeal - not sure. Whatever it is, season it well -- I put in some cayenne for heat, but you could probably just do salt and a lot of pepper, and then paprika or whatever you would like -- and toss it with a spoon of oil (I used canola) just so it's a bit moist. Then bread the chicken - the yogurt will make the breading stick beautifully - and put them in pans and put the pans in the oven.</p>
<p>35-40 minutes later, <em>holy shit</em>. Baked chicken, but exploding with flavor and crispy and brown on the outside as if it had been fried, except it's <em>healthy</em> (sort of -- healthier than fried chicken anyway) and with the cayenne giving it a little heat, the mustard seeds crunching satisfyingly, the spices exploding into the juices that flood your mouth when you bite...</p>
<p>Yes, the chicken would be crispier if I'd baked it on a rack instead of in a pan (where the juices made the breading slightly soggy on the bottom). I don't have a rack. I don't care. It's great. I eat mostly vegetarian meals these days (although I'm not a vegetarian) but tonight's dinner consisted of three giant pieces of chicken and some braised brussels sprouts, Â and I couldn't be more satisfied.</p>
<p>For the sprouts: heat a thin film of oil in a frying pan, cut the sprouts in half and brown them cut-side down over medium-high heat, then pour broth (chicken, vegetable, whatever) into the pan and cover it and let it braise until a fork goes straight through 'em, then uncover and keep cooking until the liquid evaporates. Done. If you use milk instead of broth and throw some salt/pepper/random-spices in, it's even better, but I had no milk tonight.</p>
<p>I would totally cook this for a crowd.</p>
