<p>Sunday. Spinach and feta cheese croissant, blues music alternating with Coldplay, and me on the sofa with a big black jacket because of the cold, determined to end my email backlog, and to end it here and now.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to it being warm again. I am looking forward to people being here again.</p>
<p>Okay, email backlog. Let's scope this out a bit; there are 763 messages I've got to get through, some of them over 2 years old. Some I'm afraid to reply to; some I haven't had time to read. Some I shouldn't reply to at all, but haven't brought myself to cave into that realization yet. It's dumb, but I worry about having an email backlog <i>far too much</i>. It's the constant tinny ringing noise of things that haven't been <i>done</i>. And it <i>bothers</i> me.</p>
<p>Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You filled my inbox. <i>Prepare to die.</i></p>
