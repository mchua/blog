<p>Via <a href="http://www.harihareswara.net/">Sumana</a>, a <a href="https://aharoni.wordpress.com/2011/08/24/the-software-localization-paradox">post</a> by <a href="https://aharoni.wordpress.com/about/">Amir Elisha Aharoni</a> on the paradox of localization:</p>
<blockquote><p>People<br />
who don’t know English strongly prefer to use software in a language<br />
they know... People who do know<br />
English often prefer to use software in English even if it is available<br />
in their native language. The two most frequent explanations for that<br />
is that the translation is bad and that people who want to use computers<br />
should learn English anyway. The problem is that for various reasons<br />
lots of people will never learn English even if it would be mandatory in<br />
schools and useful for business. They will have to suffer the bad<br />
translations and will have no way to fix it.
<p>So this is the paradox – to fix localization bugs, someone must<br />
notice them, and to notice them, more people who know English must use<br />
localized software, but people who know English rarely use localized<br />
software... Even people<br />
who know English well should use software in their language... especially<br />
if it’s translated badly, because they are the only ones who can report<br />
bugs in the translation or fix the bugs themselves...</p>
<p>I am glad to say that i convinced most people to whom i spoke about<br />
it at Wikimania to at least try to use Firefox in their native language<br />
and taught them where to report bugs about it. I also challenged them to<br />
write at least one article in the Wikipedia in their own language, such<br />
as Hindi, Telugu or Kannada – as useful as the English Wikipedia is to<br />
the world, Telugu Wikipedia is much more useful who speak Telugu, but no<br />
English.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://aharoni.wordpress.com/2011/08/24/the-software-localization-paradox/#comment-3242">comment</a>,<br />
summarized: can the software be hacked to make this easy for<br />
multilingual users to contribute to? Imagine being asked to opt-in for <i>occasionally</i><br />
having the application start up in (or switch into) another language<br />
you know -- for instance, "every 25th time you log into this website,<br />
you'll see it in Hindi" -- with a reminder shown during those<br />
language-switching times thanking you for aiding with translation<br />
quality and giving you a direct link to report translation problems?</p>
<p>Because sometimes the problem is just a <i>little</i> too much friction;<br />
switching the language of an application takes 5 too many mouse-clicks<br />
to be thoughtlessly easy, and the vast majority of users don't wake up<br />
in the morning and think "you know, I could <i>contribute</i> to the localization of the software on my computer!" The lazier people can be and still help you, the more likely they'll be to do it.</p>
<p>Which applications, or which types of applications, would be easiest to do this with?</p>
