<ol>
<li>go to Washington DC</li>
<li>go to New York</li>
<li>return to Boston; take all needed graduate school entrance examinations (...studying? what's that, you say?)</li>
<li>go to California</li>
<li>go to Raleigh</li>
<li>return to Boston; interview a ton of people for a book (well, at least it sounds more interesting if I call it that)</li>
<li>dunno; probably sleep and relax for a couple hours before August starts</li>
</ol>
<p>It's actually kind of a relaxing summer. The Mel likes!</p>
