<p>Ran across this John Maeda post that I'd like to share. Original at <a href="http://plw.media.mit.edu/people/maeda/posts/thegift.html">http://plw.media.mit.edu/people/maeda/posts/thegift.html</a></p>
<p>My favorite parts:</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">What Sasaki meant, I think, is that it is a real gift to think of all kinds of things you can possibly do. Unfortunately, it can be a curse because it prevents you from ever doing anything at all... So the gift of ideas, is the curse of doing nothing.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span>And then this...<span style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p></span><span style="font-style: italic;">"Doing" is outright dirty in the land of pure academia. There is a saying that supports this mindset with negative connotations, "Those who do, do. Those who can't, teach." I would change this to, "Those who are young, should do. Those who teach, should do too." Do not waste your precious gift while young and able. Do. And do not fear the curse of "the gift."</p>
<p></span>That's pretty much what I needed to hear at this point in my life. I think I'm going to nail the words "DO SOMETHING" to my wall, no matter where I happen to live; it means a lot on a myriad of levels to me, and is a reminder to kick my butt into the right kind of action.</p>
<p>Now off to do something.<br /><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></p>
