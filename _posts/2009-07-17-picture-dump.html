<p>I keep thinking I'll be able to take beautiful pictures and use them to illustrate well-written posts. Then I get hung up with perfectionism. Then I realize that dumping pictures with descriptions to the internet allows me to draw on more material later while getting this off my "to-do" list now.</p>
<p>Colin's amazing; he's a community gardening natural - I'm not sure if he realizes that yet, though I keep on trying to tell him. After getting together gurufest and booking me as the first speaker, he arranged rides (I didn't have to lift a finger) and then, at the last minute, the ride fell through and I got a phone call. "Hey. The driver couldn't make it. So I'm borrowing a tandem bike and giving you a ride."</p>

<p>Me at Red Hat intern orientation at the end of May striking my best Shadowman (Shadwoman?) post. The rock says "Ethics: the unalterable bedrock of Red Hat." I'm still not sure what one is supposed to do with it. It is too large for standard slingshots.</p>

<p>The RapidSMS folks architecturing up their own open-source project community for mobile applications for the third world, based on software they already develop and use but which doesn't have a good roadmap/process for moving forward and allowing others to easily join them in making and using it. I am <i>so proud</i> of them. That summit was <i>awesome.</i></p>

<p>The next few pictures are all from Chestnut Farms, where pika gets its (delicious, free-range, organic, humanely raised) meat. The farmers there take obvious pride in their animals, and love them, and love what they do. It's the kind of operation I want to support - I'm starting to move towards not eating meat that doesn't come from suppliers like this.</p>

<p>These are turkey pullets. Not chicken chicks, like I first assumed.</p>

<p>These guys make amazing BBQ ribs.</p>

<p>And that's a pig pen. See why I love this place?</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="http://blog.melchua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/cimg4004.jpg" height="388" width="518" /></p>
<p>Similarly, that's the chicken coop.</p>

<p>The farm itself is absolutely beautiful (and still under restoration/reconstruction - note demolished building in front).</p>

<p>Finally, I Can Haz Cheezburger (at In N' Out in California).</p>

<p>I wasn't particularly hungry, so I just had a chocolate shake, a double double, and a cheeseburger, then helped my brother polish off his Animal fries. Mm. Early 20s metabolism indeed.</p>
<p>That clears most of the good stuff from my camera. I am content.</p>
