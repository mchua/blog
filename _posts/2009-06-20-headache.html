<p>Oh geez, I've got a backlog. Gotta be smarter about this, since I can't actually type more than I already am. Reassessing over OPERATION: WEEKEND!!! - I gotta make sure I can prioritize well before next week when the travel starts to hit.</p>
<p>I am reminded of <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FK4nh5I0jpE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FK4nh5I0jpE</a>, and that I  need to learn how to do <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRkZN27Hp_k">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRkZN27Hp_k</a>  instead.</p>
<p>I'm well aware that the perceived lessened ass-kicking is actually the temporary dip that comes right before you break out of a plateau, so once that spontaneous rewiring happens, things will rock.</p>
<p>Piano results today: I can play over half the major scales now, fluently, at a moderate tempo, with good even fingerings!</p>

<p>...leads to early bedtime. Not actually sleepy, <br />
  just courting unconsciousness to make it stop (and to incidentally reset my wake-ups to a more reasonable time).</p>
