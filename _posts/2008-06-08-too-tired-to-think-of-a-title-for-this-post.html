<div style="">The last few days have been reminiscent of being - oh, around 14 years old again. I'm perfectly healthy, super-energetic and mildly hyperactive (no longer sick, yay!) and under a constant haze of sleep deprivation. It feels comfortingly familiar, because I felt like that <i>all the darn time</i> through high school and most of college. It is also most definitely not optimal - I don't know how I <i>did </i>things in this state for nearly 6 years.</p>
<p>My work hours don't sound so bad if I say I was at the office from 10 to 5:45 yesterday and omit the "pm to am" bit. Went to bed around 6:30am; was back in the office by 10 (woke up while stumbling down the sidewalk to the train, blinking and wondering why it was so <i>bright</i> outside, and <i>warm</i>, wasn't it night-time?) Still at the office now, and my productivity has ground to a halt so I'm clearing my inbox and... and I'm going to... sleep tonight.</p>
<p>I miss my posse. Chris is on a winery tour, Tank is (presumably) exploring Boston, and Nikki's off at the Cape - all well-deserved vacations. On the up side, I have a gorgeous minivan (well, will have; picking up in a week, but it's as good as done). And small doses of randomness from friends, like the<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RyodnisVvU"> yellow drum machine</a> (from Gui) and notes on <a href="http://gregmarra.tumblr.com/post/37553342/graffiti">graffiti</a> from Greg, are keeping me sane. My aunt and her family are also good at that.</p>
<p>Finally, Christoph (from Austria) and Seth (from Washington) are here at the OLPC office - hurrah for hacker friends!</div>
