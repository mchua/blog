<p>In the form of a kind of checklist,   because I swear I will forget otherwise. The "how long to keep what" is embedded within.<br /><b><br />Daily: </b>
<ul>
<li>don't spend money you don't need to spend</li>
<li>don't spend money you don't need to spend</li>
<li>don't spend money you don't need to spend</li>
<li>basically, yeah. Save money.</li>
<li>One book said you could toss phone bills, utility bills, and grocery receipts as soon as they were paid. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Monthly:</b>
<ul>
<li>Check your balance statements with your receipts and records</li>
<li>Put extra Fun Money into Next Big Thing fund</li>
<li>Toss canceled checks over a year old</li>
<li>Toss credit card statements and receipts over a year old, unless you need them for taxes, insurance, or a warranty</li>
<li>Toss bank statements over 3 years old</li>
<li>Make (read: relabel) new folders as appropriate for upcoming month</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Annually: </b>
<ul>
<li>Rebalance your investments</li>
<li>Other stuff I'm sure I should think of here but am not thinking of right now</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Stuff to keep forever (yes, in folders! more folders! a lot of them!):</b>
<ul>
<li>birth cert</li>
<li>college transcripts</li>
<li>credit card agreement (as long as you have the card)</li>
<li>diplomas</li>
<li>insurance policies</li>
<li>loan agreements, if you have any</li>

<li>receipts for major purchases (you get to define "major")</li>
<li>social security</li>
<li>retirement plan docs</li>
<li>tax returns, forms, and docs (can toss receipts in 3 yeras)</li>
<li>warranties (as long as they last)</li>
<li>work performance reviews, memos on job performance</li>
<li>year end pay stubs &amp; bonus statements</li>
<li>year end transaction statements from mutual fund companies</li>
<li>your immortal soul (putting it down as collateral for a loan is generally considered to be Not A Good Idea)</li>
</ul>
