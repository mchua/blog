<p>12 hours of sleep? It's been a while since I hit that number. I just sort of lay down on the couch and <i>bam</i>, out like a light for 3 hours, woke up long enough to stagger to my actual mattress, continued to sleep. To be fair, I was conscious for a good portion of that time between 2:30am and 8:30am, lying in bed and thinking, but the line between light sleep and deep thought with my eyes closed gets pretty hazy, so it was probably more like 7-9 hours of sleep than 12. Definitely not continuous.</p>
<p>It felt good. i don't think I really was all that sleep-deprived, per se - more rest-deprived than anything else. Usually, lying conscious but immobile for 6 hours would drive me completely insane, but it just felt really <i>good</i>. I got up when I felt antsy enough not to be able to lie still any more.</p>
<p>Spent some time reading a great <a href="http://www.oneofthewolves.com/2008/12/15/driving-best-practices/">post</a> from Tim on the (misbegotten) notion of "best practices." (Make sure to read the things he links to, particularly all the comments on the James Bach post.) Re-read the support-gang <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Support_meetings/20081214">notes</a> (publicly posted - thanks Adam!) about OLPC's new "Change The World" program, previously known as "Give Many." Laughed at the <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2007/10/01/in-manila/">familiarity</a> of Sumana's <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/%7Esumanah/cgi-bin/nb/nb.cgi/view/weblog/2008/12/15/0">post</a> on being stuffed silly during visits to family. It was a good brain wakeup.</p>
<p>I've only got 40 emails left to clean up this morning, and then - long hot shower. Nice fruit breakfast with croissants. And then... work!</p>
<p>Hm, I wonder when I'll get back to whittling down my inbox again. Maybe tonight?</p>
