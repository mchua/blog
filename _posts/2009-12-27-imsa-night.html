<p>Spent the evening with IMSA (high school) friends: Shreyas, the betting pool is still on), we stuffed ourselves silly with Olive Garden breadsticks (and yes, food too) and went back to Sharon and Michael's place to play Rock Band - Beatles edition, of course. Sharon and Shreyas were the two who got me into Beatles music back in high school; I am nowhere near as big a fan as they are, but due to the sheer repetition of John/Paul/George/Ringo songs being played and sung in my vicinity during the entirety of my high school career, they're the only band whose songs I know all the lyrics to. And the music <i>is</i> good. And the company was wonderful. Before dinner:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Positive integer?"<br />"4."<br />"Negative pi."<br />"See, we can't even say 'pick a number.'"<br />"Well, I'm picking a menu item modulo 3, and I'm not going to do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_function">floor</a>."</p></blockquote>
<p>Mid-dinner:</p>
<blockquote><p>"It depends on whether I pass my quals. If I pass them, 3-4 years. If I don't, then..."<br />"What's the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value">expected value</a> of your graduation?"<br />"The expected... oh, 3 years."<br />"So you'll probably pass, then."<br />"Yeah."</p></blockquote>
<p>I got advice from the guys on grad school, which can be summarized as follows: (1) What social life? (2) TAing will give you war stories, and (3) Make sure you have something that <i>isn't</i> school in order to stay sane. After dinner, we duct-taped the last Rock Band mic from the ceiling so that Sharon and Shreyas could simultaneously play guitar and sing. It's been a long time since I heard them harmonize like that - I used to love to hear them sing as we walked back to the dorms after class, or when Sharon and I would stand outside Shreyas's window and listen to him and his roommate Adam play guitar. My contribution for the evening was to squeak up from "medium" to a reasonably decent showing on the highest level in bass and the second-highest level in drums (my Rock Band gaming philosophy: if I'm not madly scrambling to figure out what notes to hit, it isn't hard enough).</p>
<p>And when I sprawled back on the couch after Rock Band, Shreyas elbowed me. "Hey Mel, you're tired? Sharon, look - she's <i>tired</i>!" "No, really?" "The little girl who could never sleep!" "Ah, I still don't." "How is this possible?" "Chocolate martini. I'm a lightweight."</p>
<p>"You know what's funny?" Sharon said. "We've known each other for almost 10 years." And so we have. 3 years of high school, 4 years of college (at 3 different schools), and now 2.5 years after college. The length of our friendship is almost exactly the same as the length of my social life, and this is not entirely a coincidence.</p>
<p>Huh. I feel old tonight.</p>
