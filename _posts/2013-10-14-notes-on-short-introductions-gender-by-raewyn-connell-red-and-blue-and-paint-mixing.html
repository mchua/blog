<p>Let me start off with Connell's definition of gender: "Gender is the structure of social relations that centres on the reproductive arena,   and the set of practices that bring reproductive distinctions between bodies into social processes." (p. 11)</p>
<p>Now let me try something different for reading notes on <em>this </em>book: instead of a frantic attempt to discuss <em>all </em>my exhaustive thoughts on it,   what if I (gasp) prioritized and <em>didn't say everything?</em></p>
<p><strong>Connell, R. (2009). <i>Gender: in world perspective</i>. Cambridge: Polity.</strong></p>
<p>I'd like to focus my reflections here on two related points: first, that gender ultimately refers to reproductive differences (male/female), and that language and gender (and performativity) are inexorably intertwined.</p>
<p>On page 42, Connell brings up Judith Butler's <em>Gender Trouble</em>, which rocked the 1990's gender-research world: "Gender is performative, bringing identities into existence through action, rather than being the expression of some pre-existing reality." This is exactly what p. 18-19 illustrate when telling the story of Mpondo migrant mine workers and their families, who saw <em>ubudoda </em>(manhood) as something that women could -- and did -- possess, managing households and holding together rural communities in the absence of their men, who were working in the city mines. The women performed masculinity.</p>
<p>That last sentence, "the women performed masculinity," could be seen in a number of different ways. If we think of gender as a pre-existing reality, ubudoda would be something the women "put on" in a sort of... deceptive, or false, or somehow <em>lesser </em>way. Performances are fake. "Real" members of a group don't need to "perform" membership in that group. However, if gender is a performance by <em>everyone </em>in the first place (how else do you see outward signs of group membership?), the womens' performance was no more or less "true" than the performance of masculinity by men.</p>
<p>I nearly typed "actual men" in that last sentence, and wonder how it'd change the meaning of the sentence if I did -- acknowledging the many people in the world who don't identify as one side or the other of a neat male/female binary. This is one reason I stumble over Genesis 1:27:<em><br />
</em></p>
<blockquote><p>So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; <em>male and female he created them.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Do we read these words and infer a binary -- "a bucket for male and a bucket for female he created, and in one bucket or another he created each individual human being, and if you're not neatly in one bucket or the other you've <em>got it wrong</em>"?</p>
<p>Or do we read them and infer a spectrum -- "maleness and femaleness he created, and with some mixture of the two he created each individual human being"?</p>
<p>Or do we read them and think about something else entirely -- "maleness and femaleness and <em>hey who knows what other things </em>he created..."</p>
<p>There are an infinite number of ways to express femininity and womanhood, but there are also an infinite number of shades of red. Do we say:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">There is one shade of red (pure red) and one shade of blue (pure blue) and everyone is either red or blue.</span></li>
<li>There are infinite shades of red and infinite shades of blue, but everyone is either (some sort of) red or (some sort of) blue.</li>
<li>Whoa, purple!</li>
<li>Whoa, <em>yellow!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>My understanding of Connell's take on Butler is that we, each of us, mix our own colors constantly throughout life, based on what we want to show others on our canvas.</p>
