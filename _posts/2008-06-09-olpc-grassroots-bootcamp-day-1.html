<div style="">  Day 1 - done. Representatives from 5 out of 7 continents (how can we get a visitor from Antarctica in this week? I'm sure we can find somebody from Australia...) were present today along with plenty of brainstorming and great pizza.</p>
<p>I've already done a long, long update at the link above, so read on to find out what kinds of grassroots community infrastructures we worked on - the train's coming, so I've got to run (or else sleep on the office floor again).</div>
