<p>I learned a new phrase today.</p>
<p>开源软件 means "open source software." It's pronounced "kai yuan ruan jian" with the following tones... uh... there isn't really a good way to... do this... *image editing!*</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1687" title="open-source-in-chinese" src="http://blog.melchua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/open-source-in-chinese1-300x86.jpg" alt="open-source-in-chinese" width="300" height="86" /></p>
