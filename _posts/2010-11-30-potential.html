<p>Thanks, <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2010/11/work-and-life-2/">Sacha</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s not about the theoretical best. This is something I had to come to terms with years ago. If you worry too much about living up to your “full potential”, you’ll never be happy... what matters is that I build a life that fits me, and I share what I’m learning along the way so that  other people can build even better lives.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm discovering that building a life - rather than hyperoptimizing it - is hard, but worthwhile.</p>
