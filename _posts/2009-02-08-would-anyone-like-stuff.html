<p>There are some things I've been uncovering that I <em>really</em> don't need,   but want to see if others can find a good use for it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Old hearing aid earpieces.</strong> I would actually love to spend some time in the matsci lab playing with these. I have no idea what they're made of - it's two materials, a softer one that enters the ear canal and a more brittle one for the remainder that hooks into the crevices of your ear. At the very least I want to get a close-up microscope picture and a flexure test of where the two materials join. (For that matter, if someone can figure out how to hook generic earbuds / a recorder / something into the slim tubes that go from the hearing aids into the earmolds - basically, replace the earmolds with something you can listen/record through - we can have a fun time playing with figuring out exactly what the little bugger amplifies, and/or you can hear what I mean by "there are more sounds, but they sound awful.")</li>
<li><strong>Two pairs of old eyeglasses.</strong> Where can I find a Lions Club drop-box for them or something? They're fantastic, just out of prescription.</li>
<li><strong>A nifty valve<em> </em></strong>that I wanted to share with others who apprecate elegant mechanical and materials design (though perhaps not ease-of-manufacture). I cut it from a box of water we finished in Tasmania. Yes, I carried a valve in my backpack across 6 cities in 2 continents for 2 weeks just because I wanted to show it to people. It's not a big deal. I just thought it was... cool.</li>
<li><strong>A Cubase AI4 CD</strong> (unused) which came with my keyboard. It's Windows/Mac only, so it's a paperweight to me, but someone else might enjoy having a legal copy of audio software I've never heard of before.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all I have right now.</p>
