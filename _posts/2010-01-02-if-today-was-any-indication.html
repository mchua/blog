<p>...of how the remainder of 2010 will go, it's going to be a very good year.</p>
<p>I woke up in a warm bed fully refreshed, had a lovely giant mug of tea, then breakfast, then another giant mug of tea. Blueberry crepes appeared halfway through the morning. I knocked out some solid progress on my to-do list, kept up with emails (even made a dent in my backlog), did not get interrupted, had a pleasant dinner with my family, read, had some good writing-braindumps, had some wonderful conversations with friends that made me (1) think and (2) appreciate the privilege of being able to hang out with folks this awesometastic...</p>
<p>In general, I've been in a happily relaxed flow state all day. Not uncontrollably hyperfocused (I was able to effortlessly direct my focus today - this is rare, and lovely when it happens!) or totally scattered (though I was able to effectively multitask and take in many things at once), not isolationist (though I did get solo work done) nor all socializing/talk (though I loved the conversations that I had), not sedentary (though I did relax) and not totally overclocking my physical capacities (though I did run about and move and it felt quite good).</p>
<p>In other words, today I had something that often eludes me: <i>balance</i>.</p>
<p>Here's to many more days of finding the same. I'm off to stretch, then to read, then to bed. Ahh, this is good.</p>
