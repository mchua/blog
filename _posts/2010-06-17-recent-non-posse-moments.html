<p>I've mostly been doing POSSE the past two weeks. But not always.
<ul>
<li>Brazilian steakhouse with Peter (Robinson, from Fedora/Sugar) and Peter (Froelich, from Johns Hopkins) after the end of POSSE Worcester, wherein much fruitful discussion about FOSS and TOS and POSSE was had. (Okay, it was <i>related</i> to POSSE. But it wasn't actually POSSE. I mean... look, I have to start <i>somewhere</i>, okay?)</li>
<li>Consuming a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Tahou_Hots#Garbage_Plate">garbage plate</a> at Mike's - same place as Greg and I had our first ones last October. Greg wore his Manstyle jacket (insie joke - it's the one he wore in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b42bPNOdkA0">F12 video</a>) for that occasion, so when I saw him online tonight after my plate, I joked that I needed one too, but "Womanstyle" just didn't... have the same ring to it. (Perhaps it should, but gendered word connotations do exist.) I wonder how I might affix a "Melstyle" patch to one of my jackets. This may involve learning how to sew. Or figuring out how iron-ons work.</li>
<li>RHCE schedule craziness coordinating with the CommArch guys. If we can <i>all</i> take the virtual class together, then the exam right after... the hard part is hitting the scheduling. I'm gunning for either "right before I leave for POSSE China" or "right after I get back from POSSE South Africa."</li>
<li>An interesting convo with lmacken, remyd, and ctyler at dinner tonight about project governance, which turned into a conversation specifically about Fedora governance with Chris on the way home. This ability to zoom back and introspect on different worldviews is... well, it's fascinating. It may turn into a longer blog post at some point, but the thoughts I'm having from this conversation haven't really been fully-formed into words in my head yet.</li>
<li>Anticipation of July 4th in Boston. <a href="http://www.projectbestideaever.com/">Project Best Idea Ever</a> strikes again. I am fuzzy on my 7/4 plans, but they do involve the Boston fireworks, and I might just be lazy and spring for a package here... I don't really want the party, though, just boat + food and the ability to hang out with Olin peeps I like and haven't seen for a while.</li>
<li>Sleep? Sleeeeeep. Also, I think it's the coolest thing ever that someone wrote <a href="http://www.becomingbatman.com/">Becoming Batman</a>, which takes a scientific look at whether someone could actually <i>train</i> themselves to be Batman. Well-written, too. So far.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm going to have so much backlog next week to recover from. Max is insisting that I take some time to rest. I'll take a day sometime midweek, I think. Some urgent backlog-clearing to do first, likely, but... I'll figure that out... later.</p>
