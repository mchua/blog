<p>Fedora's suspend-resume is <i>awesome</i>. I can actually throw my laptop closed and into my bag at a moment's notice, pick it up a few hours later without getting third-degree burns, and still have battery life. Hibernate, however, takes <i>forever</i>. And sometimes doesn't work (I'm going to start keeping track). Ubuntu was the other way around. I wonder why. Time to gather data so I can figure out how to ask these questions.</p>
<p>Yesterday ended up being a day for music, with interruptions only for dinner at pika and watching the (hilarious) semifinals of the MIT 100k competition which my friend Amanda is running. Kevin had a gig at <a href="http://wallyscafe.com">Wally's</a> last night and I went in, got a coke, sat down, and then they started playing Trinkle Trinkle (a fiendishly difficult Monk piece I can't even <i>listen</i> to) and my jaw dropped and stayed open for the next two hours (I had to leave early to catch the train home).</p>
<p>Armed with a crash skim through my book on jazz theory, I went in going "okay, now I'm going to try to <i>figure</i> this <i>out</i>!<i>" </i>The entirety of insightful writing from my notebook follows.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_%28music%29">head</a> ---&gt; ZOMGWTFBBQ ---&gt; head</p></blockquote>
<p>...yeah, that would be for some value of "insightful." I don't think I've ever seen a string bass strummed to produce chords before - that was pretty cool. I was also struck by how much people <i>didn't</i> play - I think solo classical piano gave me the assumption that you have to be playing something interesting and complicated All The Time. You'd think that 7 years with long rests in the cello section would have taught me otherwise.</p>
<p>I'm going to need to figure out how to memorize more tunes (how the heck did they play for so long without sheet music or a fake book?) and how to hear myself while other people are playing while listening to them at the same time (there were some really cool back-and-forths between the piano and the drummer) and how to figure out how solos get passed around between musicians. I'm starting to pull out things I learned from doing improv theatre and see if I can translate them to music.</p>
<p>Now that I can listen to jazz for extended periods of time without going "aah! It's awesome but it hurts!*" I'm trying to start understanding what I'm listening to. Right now, I'm cursing whenever the camera cuts away from Bill Evans's hands because I can't hear** half the notes I'm <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57HnHX-BlRg">trying to transcribe</a> and how else am I supposed to know what they are?</p>
<p>*The same kind of mental pain that happens when you turn on hearing aids you haven't worn for months and go "AAH! Noises that I can't differentiate!" It's not loud, it's not physical pain... it's... mental dissonance? Floods of unprocessable input.</p>
<p>*Notes are generally grouped into 3 categories for me, from low to high: (1) can hear and identify, (2) can hear but can't differentiate - I just know "there's a really high note playing somewhere" and (3) have no idea that a sound was made. Which notes are in which category depends on the instrument, listening environment, how awake I am, and so on. The vast majority of what Bill Evans does in that video falls in category (2), but enough are in (1) that I can sort of pick out bits and try to extrapolate the "there was a high note here" stuff for when the ratio of (2) to (1) isn't too high. I don't know what I'm missing for (3).</p>
