<p>Geeks crashing after hackathons.</p>
<p>The ways in which people crash when they're utterly exhausted after a long work sprint are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inventive - where do they sleep? what do they sleep on? how do they block out light and sound? what do they use for blankets?</li>
<li>Informative - you learn a lot about someone by seeing what drives them to stay up past their bedtime</li>
<li>Touching - this most of all. Sleeping hackers remind me a little bit of sleeping children. They fall asleep so full of dreams.</li>
</ol>
<p>My lunch today:</p>
<ol>
<li>celery sticks (there was an entire head... plant... thing of celery in our fridge; it needed to be eaten)</li>
<li>peanut butter (to go with celery sticks)</li>
<li>mint chocolate chip ice cream cake (thank you, <br />
  Gustavo!)</li>
</ol>
<p>Lissa taught me how to bake bread at pika last night. It was delicious! And much easier than I had thought. Perhaps I should do this sort of thing more.</p>
