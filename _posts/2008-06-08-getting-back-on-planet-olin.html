<div><em>From an email I just sent, after replying to Adam/Joe's <a href="http://www.philonoist.net/2008/06/07/the-death-of-planet-olin/">post</a> about the death of planet olin:</em></p>
<p>Yo.</p>
<p>As best as I can recall, you're in charge of Planet Olin these days - would you mind adding this feed to the list? I've started an 'olin' category on my current blog for Olin-relevant posts, and would love to jump back into the stream of Olin news.</p>

<p>(this shows things from <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/category/olin">http://blog.melchua.com/category/olin/</a>)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><em>So yep... Olin folks, I'm coming back to the Planet. I will warn, however, that very few of my posts these days are what I'd consider to be Olin-relevant, so it's going to be very much a trickle.</em></p>
