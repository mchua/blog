<p>I love this <a href="http://steelgryphon.com/grand/?p=85">post by Lucy</a> and the <a href="http://steelgryphon.com/grand/?p=85#comment-8956">comments by Sumana</a> and <a href="http://steelgryphon.com/grand/?p=85#comment-8960">Sanders</a>. Not necessarily because I agree or disagree or have particular thoughts on the matter, but because I love watching this sort of discussion - watching teaches me how to potentially <i>participate</i> in those discussions, down the road, should I choose to say something I have to say. (Right now, I don't have much to say.) I like picking up skills as I need them, and I also like picking up <i>awareness</i> that I can pick up these skills - and a notion of how I could learn them and who could teach me - well in advance of needing them, or starting to learn.</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://iquaid.org/">Karsten</a>: there's a <a href="http://www.cnvc.org/">Center for Non-Violent Communication</a>, and they have books and classes. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_communication#Definition">definition according to Wikipedia</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Language, thoughts, communication skills and means of influence that serve my desire to do three things:
<ul>
<li>to liberate myself from cultural learning that is in conflict with how I want to live my life.</li>
<li>to empower myself to connect with myself and others in a way that makes compassionate giving natural.</li>
<li>to empower myself to create structures that support compassionate giving.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds about right - particularly the first bullet point. I'm interested in how they put these concepts together into a teachable framework - how do you get something to the point where you can say "if I do $this_thing, then X% of the people present will $understand in a $short_period_of_time"? And sometimes $this_thing is improvise - sometimes it's "send one of these people because no two classes are the same but they can adapt to anything" - and sometimes what it means to $understand can shift and change from person to person, time to time, place to place - but it's teachable. Deployable. Spreadable.</p>
<p>I'm having some trouble with "release early, release often" right now - my fingers don't want to sit down and type my messy handwritten grad school application notes (whiteboards, notebooks... dating back <i>months!</i> of continuous revisions) into digital form. <i>Wait, Mel</i>, I say. <i>Aren't you supposed to be able to do this stuff? Isn't RERO a cornerstone of open source practice?</i> It is. And it's sometimes really, really hard for me to do, too. And I'm working on it - these have to be typed and uploaded, and the deadline I've set for myself is 8.5 hours from now. Self-imposed <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/%7Ercrosing/calhob.html">last-minute-panic</a> (I always think of this Calvin and Hobbes strip when I say that) occasionally works wonders.</p>
<p>I spent the weekend resting - my variant of it, anyway. A lot of reading, thinking, music (sightreading a lot of Mozart on demand from curious Audrey), cooking, a little working, library run with Melanie, reading through a 2-foot stack of books after dinner tonight (well, okay, more like 1 ft 10 in, but still - felt <i>great</i>). Coffee, of course. And yes, the next day I did get joking "...is the caffeine still in your system?" comments because I'm still hyper and excited, even when I'm resting - but I'm resting. No dancing; no MIT Mystery Hunt, no Sunday bar hangout, nothing requiring extroversion. I needed an emotional battery recharge, and I got it. It's good. I know how to run hard. I'm learning how to run sustainably.</p>
<p>I'm off to sleep, perchance to dream, perchance to <a href="http://www.s-anand.net/calvinandhobbes.html#19891022">see some friends.</a> (I <i>love</i> Calvin and Hobbes.)</p>
