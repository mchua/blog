<p>In a little less than 2 hours, we don't know if it'll work, or if it actually is an improvement - that's why we'd love thoughts and feedback.</p>
<p>Basically, the idea is that this...</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>Full legal name (as you use it is fine)</em></li>
<li><em>City, Country; you may use your timezone if you have a compelling reason not to specify your city or country</em></li>
<li><em>Profession or Student status</em></li>
<li><em>Company, School, or other affiliation</em></li>
<li><em>Your goals in the Fedora Project</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>...can be made a lot friendlier to newcomers looking for a template email by reformatting it as something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Hi, my name is _________________ and I live in _______________ (location or timezone). My Fedora Account System (FAS) username is __________, and my IRC nick is __________. (OR: I am new to IRC and would like help getting started!)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>How this happened: <a href="http://wordshack.wordpress.com/">Robyn</a> found an <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1007">article on how alternative form formats increase sign-up</a>s; this hit IRC and the <a href="http://lists.fedoraproject.org/listinfo/marketing">Marketing list</a> in quick suggestion, whereupon <a href="http://numberedhumanindustries.wordpress.com/">Justin</a> said that "<a href="http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/marketing/2010-February/011852.html">we could also make an introduction madlib</a>, because I don't know about everyone else but I felt really uneasy about mine." A few minutes later, Robyn, Justin, Nelson, and I were editing away in Etherpad - the <a href="http://etherpad.com/ep/pad/view/marketing-intro/latest">video of edits</a> is fun to watch as people hop in and things start to snowball (look at the bottom of the document the entire time). Afterwards, I tried <a href="http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/marketing/2010-February/011857.html">rewriting my self-introduction</a> with the new template, and found that I did like the Mad Libs version better, but I'm not the best judge on whether something's actually helpful to new Marketing contributors at this point. ;-)</p>

<em>The revised introduction template, mid-revision. I'm yellow, Justin is green, Robyn is pink, and Nelson isn't here yet.</em></p>
<p><em></em>If you have a moment, take a look at the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/w/index.php?title=Introduce_yourself_to_the_marketing_group&amp;oldid=147692">old, bulleted-list version</a>, compare it to the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Introduce_yourself_to_the_marketing_group">new, Mad Libs version</a>, and let us know what you think.</p>
