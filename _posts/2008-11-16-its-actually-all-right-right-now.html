<p>I've never understood the prevalence of "it's going to be all right" as a comforting phrase. Ok, things suck <i>now</i>, it says. But someday they won't. (Well, how do you <i>know</i> that? Also, that doesn't fix the current suck.)</p>
<p>Better (for me, at least) to see it as good now. One of the reasons that it could be good now is that a probable or possible future is going to be better. Maybe <i>some</i> things are suck. But it's never the case that <i>everything</i> is awful. Even on the worst days, physics <i>works</i>. The sun continues to provide our planet with photons. Oxygen is present in the air in quantities sufficient for survival. If these things are not in a good state - the last one, anyway - you won't be around much longer to complain, so why spend your last minutes cursing at something that <i>doesn't matter</i>? Maybe some things are suck, but you're dealing with them, and isn't it good that you have that capacity?</p>
<p>I've been asked many times how I stay so damn optimistic and happy about the world. My quirky variant of naivety is Teflon-like in its resistance to bitter and jadedness despite any of the vast amounts of knowledge I have encountered or acquired through the years. How am I happy? I don't know. How could I not be? The world is crap sometimes, but life is good.</p>
<p>Note: happiness does not imply complacency, and life being good does not remove the possibility that it could be better yet. Be happy<i>, and</i> get off your duff.</p>
