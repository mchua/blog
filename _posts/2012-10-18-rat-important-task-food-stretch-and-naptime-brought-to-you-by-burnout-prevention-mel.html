<p>Woke up this morning and thought I was fine after a good 6 hours of sleep,   but after dragging through dance class,   I realized my brain was starting to spew <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/grad-student-deconstructs-takeout-menu">stuff like this</a> and that the best thing I could do for my RAT at the moment was to rest and eat and rub out the muscles in my right hip, which have gone a little funny since last night's tech rehearsal.</p>
<p>So. Next task, for a little while: cook and eat brunch, drink some water, take some vitamins, and nap. When I am rested, I will have a clearer mind.</p>
<p>My tired brain has, apparently, a funny little sense of humor -- I got a huge kick out of my buddy Seb Benthall's <a href="http://digifesto.com/2012/10/16/weird-twitter-the-symbolic-construction-of-community-through-iterative-reification/">subtle parody of academic analysis</a> (which he explains more <a href="http://digifesto.com/2012/10/18/weird-twitter-art-experiment-method-notes-and-observations/">in an aftermath post</a> because so many people didn't get it). It's this sort of humor that begins to creep increasingly into my scholarly writing when I'm tired or stressed. Interesting.</p>
