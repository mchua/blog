<p><strong>Update 22 hours later: Jef and Dave sent in card and logo redesigns,   and we now have a <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2012/02/10/eucalyptus-a-2nd-community-business-card-design-whoa-that-was-fast/">much-improved second version of the card</a>, which you should use instead. Thanks, guys!</strong></p>
<p>Folks, we've got a business card template. Here's a preview.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.melchua.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/euca-bizcard.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3416" title="euca-bizcard" src="http://blog.melchua.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/euca-bizcard-300x166.png" alt="" width="300" height="166" /></a></p>
<p>Disclaimer: I'm not a graphic designer, as this template makes painfully obvious. I threw this together in 16 minutes (yes, I timed myself) so it's a very basic design. The colors and fonts don't even match the Eucalyptus logo. However, you can use this design to run a pre-cut business card sheet through a home or hotel printer, and that's what we need, because people are going to events <em>tomorrow</em>. (Actually, at this hour, I think it may even be today already.)</p>
<p>The template is a <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> file, so you'll need that installed before you can edit it. (LibreOffice is cross-platform and commonly available in Linux distributions - OpenOffice would work too.)</p>
<p>You'll also need Gillius ADF, a Libre font from the "Gillius Collection" - download it <a href="http://arkandis.tuxfamily.org/adffonts.html">here</a>. I chose this font because it's also commonly available in the repositories of Linux distributions. Ubuntu calls it <strong>ttf-adf-gillius</strong> and Fedora calls it <strong>adf-gillius-fonts</strong> so you can <em>yum</em> or<em> apt-get</em> install to your heart's content.</p>
<p>Once you have those prerequisites installed, <a href="https://projects.eucalyptus.com/redmine/issues/134#note-1">head to this ticket to download the template</a>. Enjoy - and if you know graphic design better than I do, please feel free to fix.</p>
