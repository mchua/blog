<p>One of my cousins, a high school sophomore, wrote to me and my brother asking for advice on purchasing a first computer for high school and college. She's comfortable around computers -- she spent the summer she was 12 repairing Linux-based laptops with me in Chicago -- but that's not her primary focus, so she's probably looking for a fairly generic machine for academics and random projects (which may or may not be about computing).</p>
<p>First things first: my brother Jason recommended "something portable with good battery life" for group projects. I agreed.</p>
<blockquote><p>Remember, batteries are replaceable, and you are likely to be in for new ones<br />
every two years no matter what. If you plan on keeping your laptop for 4, that's just<br />
one battery replacement, so that's not as bad as it sounds.</p>
<p>I'll second the portability recommendation. As a Linux geek, I've found Thinkpads (I have the x200) to be well-built machines; they usually ship with Windows if that's your cup of tea. But if you like Mac, the Air looks lovely. I haven't been as impressed with Dell, Toshiba, Acer, and Gateway; their consumer-grade stuff seems to break quickly under normal use.</p>
<p>I'll also note that it's unlikely that you'll keep the same laptop through 7 years of high school and college combined -- things wear out and break, and hardware expectations get more powerful, so think of this machine as a 3-4 year purchase, something you're likely to replace either as you start college or after your freshman year (once you have a better idea of what you'll be doing for the rest of your college studies). Some college programs require you to purchase a specific laptop, and most will give you significant discounts on computer purchases, so you're really thinking "what's going to last me 'till college?" With that in mind, a used laptop in good condition is pretty appealing, as might be a netbook plus external monitor.</p></blockquote>
<p>The next thing we both commented on were accessories. Jason recommended getting an external hard drive, monitor, keyboard, and mouse, something he figured out his junior year at Stanford. I started getting clear signs of RSI well before my junior year at Olin, so I concur; ergonomics are worth it.</p>
<blockquote><p>You really do want this stuff; at the very least, stick the laptop on a stack of books so the screen is eye-height, and get an external keyboard and plop it on your lap so your wrists are straight and your arms make a (rough) "L" with your shoulders down and relaxed. If your laptop screen is small (below 12", which likely means you have a netbook) spring for a nice external and you can take it to college with you (I did, and the... hrm, maybe $700 I spent on a 24" monitor has well exceeded its return on investment -- it's been with me for nearly 7 years now).</p></blockquote>
<p>A bit of backstory: I got my first computer when I was 15, after 5 years<br />
of working and saving towards exactly that goal. That cheap little<br />
Compaq -- that, and a bunch of older buddies with a stack of Debian<br />
install floppies -- changed my life. So I know how monumental this<br />
decision can feel, and how unfamiliar the territory can seem (I didn't<br />
know <i>how</i> to learn about computers, but I sure did want one), and<br />
how impossibly expensive everything can be when you're a teenager who's<br />
not allowed to <i>think</i> about having steady external income sources yet. I literally saved until I could buy the <i>cheapest</i> desktop at the local computer store, then bought it. That was all the strategy I could think of, and at that age, I didn't know anyone else who was more well-versed in computer purchasing.</p>
<p>Of course, my 15-year-old self is a decade back, and things have changed considerably since then. If I were a 15-year-old <i>now</i> and budget was a primary concern, I'd look for a used Thinkpad in good condition. If I were thinking longer-term, I'd put most of my money into a good large monitor that could be reused in future setups, and get a reasonably oomphy netbook or smallish used laptop (perhaps the aforementioned Thinkpad), and install whichever operating system I preferred with open source office, art, etc. software. Of course, my product-design brother recommended the MacBook Air, which... <i>may</i> fit into a very lucky 15-year-old's budget, but certainly wouldn't have been within mine.</p>
<p>Anyway. That's what we told her -- anything else you'd suggest or note or recommend?</p>
