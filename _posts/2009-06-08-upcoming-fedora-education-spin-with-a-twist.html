<p>The <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Education">Fedora Education SIG</a> is <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Education/Spin">working on a new spin</a> - an <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/11">F11</a> <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_2009">POSSE</a> spin for mid-July - with some interesting goals. Instead of the usual "this distribution is for children in classrooms!" tactic, we've chosen to go the "this distribution is for people who want children in classrooms to be their users" route.</p>
<blockquote><p>The purpose of the current spin is to create a ready-to-go development environment for contributing to educational packages within the Fedora ecosystem... our target users are professors teaching classes (not necessarily education classes) who want their students to contribute to open-source education efforts as part of their coursework.</p></blockquote>
<p>Please help us think of <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Education/Spin#Features">features that should be in there</a>!</p>
<p>And also <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Education/Spin#Outreach_plan">people who should use it once it's done</a>.</p>
<p>(And pass this on to the professors and students in your life as well - we particularly need their feedback, <i>especially</i> if they're not already contributing to open-source projects.)</p>
