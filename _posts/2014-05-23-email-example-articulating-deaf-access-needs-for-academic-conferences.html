<p><em>Articulating my access needs for an academic conference has taken a long time to figure out, and I'm still wading through those waters. In case it helps others in some way,   here's an email I just sent; thanks to Mirabai for sanity-checking and courage to actually ask for what I need.Â </em></p>
<p>(in reply to a request for my conference schedule)</p>
<p>I do not have a definite schedule of my participation in the event; as a professional conference and networking function, a large part of the value comes from informal hallway conversations with colleagues, evening socials, and spontaneously being able to follow connections into/out of formal presentations.</p>
<p>What I need for full access is a CART provider assigned to me between Sunday, June 15 at 1pm through Wednesday, June 18, at 5:30pm. The CART provider either needs to follow with their equipment wherever I go or be prepared to go to wherever I text them on a minute's notice and set up there. The CART provider and I can negotiate throughout the day to make sure they have sufficient break time (I am used to working this out with CART providers). Hours would be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sunday, June 15: 1pm (Pioneers project workshop) through 9pm (Purdue Engineering Education mixer)</li>
<li>Monday, June 16: 7am (1st sessions) through 6pm (awards ceremony).</li>
<li>Tuesday, June 17: 7am (1st sessions) through 10pm (ERM division social)</li>
<li>Wednesday, June 18: 8:45am (2nd sessions; I will almost certainly skip the first session) through 5:30pm (end of last sessions).</li>
</ul>
<p>Within this, the current schedule you have for me is a reasonable first guess as to where I might be and what I might be doing, but much of the value will come from unplanned interactions outside the current tentative schedule.</p>
<p>For my own talks and presentations, we do not yet have slides or other planned material. Honestly, knowing my co-authors and our travel schedules leading right up to the conference, it's likely to be a last-minute thing. However, I've attached the two papers I will be presenting so the CART writer can get some idea of terminology, and I would be happy to coordinate with them over email, SMS, or chat beforehand to field any questions they might have. [Provider name] and some of her subcontractors have provided both remote and in-person CART for me the past 2 years and are familiar with the terminology and conventions of my field.</p>
<p>Let me know how we can set this up, and whether you have any questions. I've copied [my counselor] from the Purdue Disability Resource Center on this email so that everybody's in the loop.</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>--Mel</p>
