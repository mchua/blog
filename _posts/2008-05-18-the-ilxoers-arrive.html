<p>I swear I'm going to leave this office before 5am because I want to come back at 8am or before.</p>
<p>The ILXO folks (Chris, Nikki, and Tank) moved into their new apartment today, which took most of the morning. I'm amazed at their dedication - immediately after several grueling weeks of finals and projects and presentations, they moved across town the day across graduation and then promptly came into the office <em>at 11:30 pm</em> (without even pausing to unkink their shoulders from hauling blue bins of books up 4 flights of stairs) to prep laptops for the demos they're running at Ridiculously Early Hours tomorrow morning. <em>And</em> they're putting up with insanity like this all summer for a $0 salary).</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to the summer. Wait - it's already started. (YAY!)</p>
<p>Also fun: mad dashes to Radio Shack right before they close, only to discover that they not only don't carry the sensor you were looking for, they appear to not carry <em>any</em> sensors (as components that aren't already integrated into overpriced consumer electronics devices on the shelves). Yep, I'm demoing Arjun Sarwal's <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Measure">Measure</a> activity tomorrow, on way too little sleep, to far too many people...</p>
<p>Okay. Time to post and run - I'm splurging on a taxi this once because I don't want to wait an hour for the first train to get here. Sleep - it's a good thing occasionally.</p>
