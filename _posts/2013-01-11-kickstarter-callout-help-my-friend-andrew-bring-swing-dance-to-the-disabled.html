<p>Ever seen someone swing dancing in a wheelchair?</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/teddybouch/blip-bringing-swing-to-panama-city-and-the-disable/widget/video.html" frameborder="0" width="480" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>Okay. Want to help more people do that?</p>
<p>Some of you have seen this, but I'm blogging it as well because the cause is very worthy. Andrew Bouchard, my friend and fellow Olin '07 alum in Florida is working on bringing the joy of dance to the disabled, and <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/teddybouch/blip-bringing-swing-to-panama-city-and-the-disable">has a Kickstarter going</a> to support the project. (Among other things, it features wonderfully geeky engineering dance shirts for $25. Feedback control loops + dance = AWESOME.)</p>
<p>They're <a href="http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/teddybouch/blip-bringing-swing-to-panama-city-and-the-disable/">pretty well on track</a> to reach their goals, but need more help to do so. If you think this is awesome, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/teddybouch/blip-bringing-swing-to-panama-city-and-the-disable">please chip in!</a></p>
