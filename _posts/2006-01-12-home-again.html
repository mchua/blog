<p>Hot showers never felt so good. In the Philippines, at least at my grandparents' house, "bath" means "fill the big bucket from the faucet and use the little scoop to pour water over your head."</p>
<p>I have a huge amount of work to catch up on in the next 9 days, but not tonight. Tonight I'm sleeping.</p>
