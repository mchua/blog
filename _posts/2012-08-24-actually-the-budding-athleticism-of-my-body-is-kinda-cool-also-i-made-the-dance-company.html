<p>I'm taking gym class this semester as a guinea pig in the student clinic where Health &amp; Kinesiology majors learn how to do personal training. We started this week by doing baseline fitness tests,   and Ethan (the student working with me) and I have been pleasantly surprised, especially I still consider myself "untrained" and "unathletic" and my body's still recovering from the hike. I performed respectably on a hip flexibility test (when lying on my back, I could raise a straight leg nearly to vertical), did 32 pushups (modified, because my legs/ankles are still a little wonky from the hike) in a minute, cranked out a 9-minute mile (still with wonky legs, but only a minute higher than my previous fastest-ever mile time), and dropped my heart rate from post-run 174 to normal in 3 minutes.</p>
<p>I know that's not particularly amazing athletic prowess, but for someone who's used to getting the lowest possible scores on any measure of physical fitness, it... felt good. I mean, I have a body! And... I'm using it! And it... it does things, and it learns, and gets stronger and faster and maybe it can get even better and maybe I could even get <em>good</em> at it! It's happened before. I used to think (in high school) that I sucked at computer stuff and would never be able to do anything useful in the tech world, and then decided that was a dumb limitation I was going to blast, and look at me now. I also used to think that my hearing meant I was broken and limited, and then my 8-year-old self got fed up with <em>that</em>, and... well, you know. So why not change myself from "hopelessly unathletic and physically unaware" to someone actually competent and joyful in that department? YEARS OF WORK ARE PAYING OFF!</p>
<p>Gym is training 3 days a week for about 45 minutes. Awesometastic. And then dance class 2 days a week, a bit over an hour, and then dance company rehearsal 2 days a week for 90 minutes...</p>
<p>Oh. I MADE THE DANCE COMPANY! Which was something of a shock, because I was <em>sure</em> I screwed my audition up completely. During callbacks, we learned more dance phrases and did some improv -- and maybe improv is what saved me, because if I am <em>supposed</em> to make things up, I do. Once I stopped paying attention to the other people around me ("what am I supposed to do? I cannot hear a thing! I must look at them constantly!") and started focusing more on my own movements, it felt way better -- and I also became much more aware of how awkward my movement patterns are, which led to a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach that I kept fighting through the 2-hour audition. If I were the type to cry more, I probably would have cried. "Well, that's it," I thought, walking dejectedly home from the end of it. "They'll never cast me. I move like a newborn cow with seizures <em>and</em> tendonitis."</p>
<p>But they did. And... so I think that means I am a dancer now. And I am looking at my training schedule, and I'm thrilled, and it's the most I've ever trained my body to do <em>anything</em> -- I'm going to be focusing on movement, physical awareness, fitness, presence, for almost 8 hours a week. And I desperately want to make sure I can keep up.</p>
<p>So I'm calling my trainer from the summer and asking her to talk with me about two things: nutrition and how-do-I-keep-my-muscles-from-hating-me.</p>
<p>I want to make sure I'm eating the right stuff this semester so that my body can survive dancing 4 days a week and working out for 3, because one thing I became acutely aware of during the Coast To Coast was that what and when and how much I eat dramatically affects my performance. (Trail mix is a godsend, and I think I ate more beef on the 2-week hike than I had the entire rest of the year to that point, because that's the format protein takes in northern England.) I want to do meal planning, batch-prepare things at the start of the week, and eat at the right times to fuel myself consistently, just like when Sumana and I were hiking. I realize this means I may mostly eat the same meals over and over. That's okay. I will have dinners and things with friends to get variety in, but breakfast, lunch, and a few dinners every week can be monotonous-yet-delicious if they'll fuel me right.</p>
<p>I also want to make sure I know how to loosen up and stretch and roll out and unknot the trigger points and funky bits so I can stay in good working order from one day to the next. I have a foam roller and a rubber ball and some other stuff I know how to use for RSI prevention in my hands and shoulders, but am only vaguely acquainted with what to do with the rest of my body ("wait, hips? I have hips?") and need to learn this NOW because my legs don't just recover magically by themselves, as it turns out.</p>
<p>Balance in my life, and sanity. This is good. This is very good. I'm so much happier when I use and inhabit (and tend to, and improve) the physical self I've been given, and it seems to correlate with better cognitive performance as well -- so that's a coping mechanism that is actually healthy. Stuck on a problem? Go for a run. Can't concentrate on a paper? Stretch. Paper driving you insane? Do pushups. In hindsight, this is a variant of ADHD Mel Does Take-Home Exams in undergrad, where I started sprinting around my dorm building before and during tests because I could not sit down to finish them otherwise. I may have been smarter when I was 17. (Actually, no, I wasn't. When I was 17, I thought sugar packets were an emergency meal substitute, and that I could get by on 6 nights of sleep a week. So never mind.)</p>
<p>You're more than a brain, Mel. Enjoy your body, too.</p>
