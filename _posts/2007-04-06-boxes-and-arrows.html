<p>A freeform poem kind of thing. I'm writing until my brain quiets down enough for me to work. (God <span style="font-style: italic;">damn</span> it. I can't get anything done today. I wonder if this is what DaVinci felt like and why he pumped out things so prolifically.) This is a poorly done rendering of a mental image I had one day when thinking about the kind of engineering I <span style="font-style: italic;">don't</span> like.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Boxes and Arrows</span></p>
<p>we chunk life into nested boxes.<br />drill down / drill deep / wrap your details up and outline them.<br />how cleanly can you draw your lines,  <br />make your abstractions,  <br />orthogonalize,  <br />and dissect,<br />vivisect<br />your problem?</p>
<p>we went out and saw<br />in the woods<br />a young deer. it was lovely.<br />and we followed it and watched it<br />quietly<br />as it drank from the water<br />as it fled from the highway<br />as it moved like a statue between the trees<br />as it ran.</p>
<p>it was a nuisance, wreaking havoc<br />on the petunias of the town.<br />so we wrestled with the image in our minds<br />and said "we have to understand it<br />find its needs and values,<br />then we can fix it, change it, fix it."<br />so we shot.</p>
<p>pinned it down, sliced it open,<br />went through it with a fine pick<br />anatomy book in one hand,<br />surgical expert on the phone.<br />referenced its datasheet model from its ear-tag<br />traced the blood flow<br />calculated how many litres were pumping onto the ground<br />saying to the glassy eyes we're sorry, sorry, but we have to <span style="font-style: italic;">know.</span><br />we'll put you back together when we're done<br />we promise.</p>
<p>and we disassembled and wrapped in plastic<br />and argued and fought until we could say<br />this is a model to the first approximation<br />which is imperfect<br />but close enough.</p>
<p>we had our boxes and our arrows.<br />and we'd promised to put him back together, so we did.<br />everything stitched into its right place,<br />everything completely summed,<br />no remainder.</p>
<p>we even siphoned the red pools off the ground and gently slipped them through a needle back into the veins.</p>
<p>we put him in a place of honor in a glass case<br />next to our diagram<br />and we said<br />problem solved.</p>
<p>I suppose in a second revision we could make him animatronic.</p>
