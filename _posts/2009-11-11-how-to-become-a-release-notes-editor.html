<p><a href="http://iquaid.org/">Karsten Wade</a> is leading our <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE">POSSE</a> group in a "let's learn how to be a contributor to Fedora Documentation!" exercise - in this case,   writing release notes. I made a screencast at the request of some of the other participants (originally screenshots until I realized it was Just Easier to use <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/ScreenCasting#Istanbul">Istanbul</a>).</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,  0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/LJXyeIS-eIU&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/LJXyeIS-eIU&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed>This way, if Karsten (or anyone else!) wants to teach the same material again, they can follow a 10.5 minute video instead of going through an hour-long explanation on IRC. Ah, the power of documentation!</p>
<p>It's worth pointing out that we didn't originally have Documentation on our "Stuff To Learn" schedule at all; this was a spontaneous happy moment, with Karsten around and offering to teach, and folks in the room deciding they wanted to learn, and me deciding to make a screencast. The unplanned-ness is probably a huge part of what made it such a good learning experience - I'm not sure how this would work as a Standard Part Of Someone's Classroom Syllabus. But... you know, I could be wrong. Teachers, what do you think?</p>
