<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EURF2PlIqtE">Cute animated cartoon</a> with <i>really awesome scene transitions.</i> Please ignore the song in French that I can't understand and the frequent 'AGH GAK KISSING" moments - I love the flash-forward time-compression techniques of Happy Seamlessness. It reminds me of the <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.11/sixwords.html">6-word-story</a> exercise (also see <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/02/14/sixword-memoirs-by-w.html">6-word-bios</a>). I did a longer 50-word variant as an extra exercise for a high school English teacher who was encouraging me to write more.</p>
<p>Ah, Dr. Kuhl. And Mr. Panitch from 6th grade. They gave me writing as an outlet, for which I am forever thankful. I wish I had continued to hone it more than I did; there's much that I can do to cut the cruft from what I write, and I am pretty sure I was a better writer at 11 and 14 (because of how much/seriously I concentrated on it) than I am today, though I have richer things and thoughts to write about now that I've actually been exposed to the world beyond my childhood home, my school, and the library in the town where I grew up.</p>
<p>I wonder what Dr. Kuhl and Mr. Panitch would say if they saw my writing now, over/nearly a decade later. I think one reason why they had such an impact on me is that writing was one of the first things I'd ever heard a teacher (or really, any grownup) say I had potential for - potential that went beyond the "give the correct answers, get good scores on tests" stuff I was doing in my normal public school classes. By no means was I a prodigy or anywhere near it; I was just a kid who liked to write. But the fact that I was <i>good</i> at something  - and, more importantly, that this was Not An Awful Thing - was still a novel concept back then. </p>
<p>Some folks have heard this story; I may have written it down somewhere before. In any case, retelling the past is part of how we shape our future selves, or so my sociology class told me.</p>
<p>I remember being 7 years old one afternoon in school, listening in dawning horror as my classmates read their essays. I was petrified to realize I'd put visibly more effort into my own paper - in other words, my paper was Different, and this was a Horrible Mistake, because I was supposed to Be Like Everybody Else, and now I had brought Shame and Dishonor on my family for making such a dumb mistake <i>at school... </i>It seems a tiny thing now, but it was <i>huge</i> to me as a little kid. Later that day when my mom told me my teacher had called, I broke down in tears. I basically never cried, both then and now, especially in front of anybody else, but I was pretty much hysterical that afternoon. And all because I thought, at 7, that putting more effort into something in a non-specified, non-pre-requested-by-a-superior-officer way, was Terrible.</p>
<p>Turns out my teacher had called to ask my mom if she had read my allegorical description of myself as a mouse that hid in fortresses of books to escape the Cat of Reality's vicious claws. (There was an illusration of a little mouse with a sword trying to fend off a cat with unrealistically pointy teeth and very, very anatomically incorrect Angry Cartoon Eyes. As a side note, this story is how I got my first online nick, 'mouseymel,' many years later.) I was reassured that I had gotten a good grade on the essay and that I could, y'know, stop crying now. (I stopped.)</p>
<p>The things which stick with you as you grow up are... interesting. And then there are things that don't. So that's the "Riting" part, this is the "Reading" one.</p>
<p>A friend of my parents told me last week that I floored him one afternoon when I was 10 - he found me reading a parenting book one day, was perplexed by this, and asked why. I explained to him I was trying to learn how parents thought, and that what I had learned was very interesting thus far. I remember reading the book (in fact, I read a lot of parenting books as a kid for just that reason), but what surprised me was to learn, 12 years later, that he'd been surprised at that. It seemed a logically normal thing to do; I found books, they looked interesting, I read them. </p>
<p>I'm <i>very</i> glad he didn't tell me that he was surprised back then. If I'd known that somebody thought that it was slightly odd to do that, I probably would have stopped immediately. Although I guess book choice and reading quantity is something I deviated from the norm from when I was tiny - I think I would have died from boredom otherwise. I was <i>overjoyed</i> in kindergarten when I learned that the lower classes (us) could check out novels and textbooks instead of only picture stories. I think I thanked our school librarian for allowing me to read the encyclopedia set. (This was a privilege that I had not expected.) And I had no objections when she gave me a special higher limit for the number of books I was allowed to check out - almost every day, I'd get the max number of books I could (iirc it was 3, then 5, then 7), stagger home with them, read them all, return them the next day and get the next 3 or 5 or 7 more...</p>
<p>Then again, my classmates didn't have to know about these things.</p>
<p>Re: "Rithmetic" - I'm pretty sure I wouldn't love math today if it hadn't been the shelf I chanced to dive behind while hiding from librarians in the Adult Section. I thought 4th graders (or was it 5th?) were not supposed to be outside the Children's Section, and that I'd get in trouble if I was discovered. But I had read through pretty much the whole darn Children's Section, and I wantd more, so I waited 'till the librarians weren't looking and snuck in. It felt like Mission: Impossible. I was the rogue spy trying to get <i>secret information!</i> that I was not supposed to have - lucky that one of first Forbidden Books I found was Martin Gardner, and <i>boom!</i> a world of mathematics opened up before me...</p>
<p>What I am trying to say is that I was the kind of timid little kid who used to follow rules - a lot - and who needed to hear "you know, I <i>know</i> that you can go beyond these standard expectations, and it's okay if you do - in fact, it's <i>really good</i>." I literally didn't realize that rules could be created, bent, and broken (instead of merely followed) until a <i>very</i> mindbending freshman year </p>
<p>Of course, now I have to relearn that sometimes one should follow rules for the sake of longer-term changes to complex systems that one can't just immediately hack... if your experience is the best teacher, mine is an incredibly sadistic one. Effective, though.</p>
<p>On the previous note of writing, is anybody planning to do <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> this year? I don't think I can do a fiction novel (as much as I really really want to finish "The World Is Too Much With Us" at some point - I've been saying this for... what, 3 years now?) but I'm trying to see if I can pull my copious word output into some sort of book-like form. I think the key for me is going to be building momentum and <i>then</i> directing it towards things that I want to write.</p>
<p>My favorite 6-word short story is the original by Hemingway. It smells faintly of young dreams, sad ones.</p>
