<p><a href="http://wordle.net/">Wordle</a> for this blog. The most surprising thing to me is the prominence of "Beethoven." Also, I use generic words a lot, and don't mention people by name often.</p>

<p>Tonight was interesting, but I won't say why. And then I had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha">kombucha</a>. Earlier today, we went to a diner for lunch and I feasted on some of the most wonderful fluffy scrambled eggs I've ever had. Tomorrow Andrew and Chris and I are going on a food adventure.</p>
<p>You can tell my mind is scattered because I'm writing about food to get it back on track, and it's not working all that well. (I'm trying to focus enough to do work before I pass out.)</p>
