<p>It's end of term reflection time, and I'm procrastinating on my Expo presentation with a blast from the past. It's turning out to be one of those "the more things change, the more they stay the same" things.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Re: inability to ask for help</span></p>
<blockquote><p>[Talking about the Olin-as-deep-end-of-pool analogy] If I sink, I will sit at the bottom and slowly drown as I stare at the sunlight filtering through the water. I won't ever let anyone save me. Some strange little part of my brain still thinks that if I let myself be saved, then I will not be able to save anybody else, when in fact it should be the other way around.</p>
<p>If I let myself be saved, that makes me fallible. Fallible people can't swoop down all godlike and help others. They might fall apart themselves. (from <a href="http://mellory.blogspot.com/2005/10/my-throat-hurts.html">here</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Re: Eye.size > stomach.size syndrome</p>
<p></span>Behold a small dipper from the continuous stream of sage professorial advice which I'll forever remain grateful for. Man, we're lucky to have great teachers here.</p>
<blockquote><p>Gill Pratt: "Life is the art of knowing which things you can let slide." (from <a href="http://mellory.blogspot.com/2005/10/ahead-in-two-classes-behind-in-two.html">here</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Re: Being simultaneously arrogant and underconfident</p>
<p></span><br />
<blockquote>I hate being smart, but I like being smart. I hate that other people think that I'm smart (I'm not). At the same time, I like that they do. (I'm not.) I like looking smart. (I'm not.) I want to think that I'm smart, and sometimes I do. (I'm not.) And I hate that I like to look smart (because I'm not).</p>
<p>Hubris, anyone? (from the same post as the first quote)</p></blockquote>
<p>I wrote this stuff when I was 19. I'm 20 now. I wonder if I'll still be able to call these things true when I'm 25. A small voice in the back of my head keeps saying it's narcissitic to quote yourself like this, so I'll stop now, reply to the comment backlogs, and then actually get back to "real work."</p>
