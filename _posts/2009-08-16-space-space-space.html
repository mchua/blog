<p>Staying in the (two bedroom, and her husband; her husband's sister and her son, my mom's 2nd sister and her two children and her husband, my mom's 6th sister, me. This isn't all that weird. When I was a kid, our (3-bedroom-turned-into-4-bedrooms-and-a-basement) house (pre-renovation; now it's bigger) held me, my brother, my mom and dad, my mom's 2nd (until she got married), 5th (until she got married), and 6th sisters (when I was <em>really</em> young, I think my mom's sisters #7 and #8 stayed with us also, and I think my dad's younger brother for a time, but memories of that period in my life are pretty fuzzy), and my mom's parents were also there half the time (and sometimes my dad's parents too).</p>
<p>This means that when I was 14 and learned that I would be sharing a tiny dormitory room with another girl for the next 3 years, my first reaction was "whoa! So much space and privacy!" And when I stepped into the hotel for POSSE and discovered that my room contained not just a bed and a bathroom (that I wasn't sharing with <em>anybody</em>!) but a little kitchenette, I was floored. That much square footage? Just for me? Whoa.</p>
<p>Today we're going to the Freedom Trail. Audrey (my 5-year-old cousin) is sitting on my lap, wearing a yellow hat. Audrey, would you like to write something? ("No.") Okay. Time to go to the Freedom Trail!</p>
