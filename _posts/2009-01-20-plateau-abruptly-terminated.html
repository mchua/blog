<p>Well. <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2009/01/16/selfcompete_againstself/">That plateau</a> ended rather sooner than I expected.</p>
<p>The last 24 hours have been intensely uncomfortable. I'm being barraged by my inability to operate at a higher level of thinking about community catalyzing and facilitation, organizations, technologies, and hacking than I'm used to. I'm expected to be able to assimilate this on my own, without hand-holding, and struggling to articulate my confusion into questions that can help me find my own way.</p>
<p>I am incredibly happy about this - I am <i>learning</i>. It feels good to be lost, to be off that plateau - even if it means I'm now in the painful backslide phase of notching my abilities up to the next level. I just have to stick in there and fight the temptation to fall back into being <i>just okay</i>, and being comfortable.</p>
<p>I'm also expecting to be barraging this blog with posts sorting out the same, once I've forced myself to fight through the worst of this confusion as fast as I can handle it. The last few weeks (months?) of sheer exhaustion have sapped me more than I'd like to admit, and now I have to learn how to perform through yet another layer of tiredness, to deal capably with more pressure and more chaos while still taking care of myself so that I can be pushed further without causing damage that I can't repair.</p>
<p>I'm happy to be tossed around, bewildered, transcribing, recording, absorbing, absorbing, absorbing, and absorbing. The question is how well I'll be able to share the lessons that I'm learning.</p>
