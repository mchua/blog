<p>Discovered a new poem today - <a href="http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/abt-vogler/"><i>Abt Vogler</i></a>, by Robert Browning. The poem is about the organist whose name is the title. It does not read to me as smoothly as the other poems I love, but it captures that fleet feeling of <i>rightness</i> when something comes through you and you create what you were meant to create at just that moment.</p>
<blockquote><p>All through my keys that gave their sounds to a wish of my soul,<br />All through my soul that praised as its wish flowed visibly forth...</p>
<p>...But here is the finger of God, a flash of the will that can,<br />Existent behind all laws, that made them and, lo, they are!<br />And I know not if, save in this, such gift be allowed to man,<br />That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star.</p></blockquote>
<p>My gifts are in a different realm, but I do know the feeling.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's going to be a day for catching up; I have a lot of ground to cover, and I'm going to do so at an easy lope. It's been a good week, but a long one. I've been more scattered than I should have been, but I have things lined up now to recover that ground - sometimes I spend longer on prep for something than doing it, which is why I occasionally look ridiculously fast when I do things. Sometimes I stand and sharpen the axe too long, though. Working on that balance. One solid normal workweek coming up - I haven't had that for a long, long time. Will make the best of it, because the holidays are coming.</p>
