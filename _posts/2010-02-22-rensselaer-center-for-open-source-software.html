<p>Fedora design guru <a href="http://mairin.wordpress.com">Mo Duffy</a> gave a <a href="http://mairin.wordpress.com/2010/02/19/rensselaer-center-for-open-source-rcos-talk-on-fedora">presentation</a> on <a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a> at <a href="http://www.rpi.edu/">RPI</a>, her alma mater. Slides are available from the post, and as usual, they're gorgeous. I'm reblogging here since Mo isn't part of <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/Planet">Planet TOS</a> and I thought some professors might be interested in the slide deck.</p>
<p>Mo's deck does a good job of addressing a problem I often have when speaking with a group of students (or for that matter, a group of people with a wide range of backgrounds in and exposure to FOSS). How do you describe such a huge and complex space ("The Fedora Project") without either oversimplifying things or getting bogged down in details for hours? Her presentation sketches out the broad outlines of a space (“look at the wide range of things you can do in Fedora!”) and then show examples of how to dive into details in a few of them (specific projects in specific teams).</p>
<p>Anyhow. There's a <a href="http://rcos.rpi.edu/">Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software</a> - this is a page I hadn't seen beforehand, and which has some projects that seem to overlap with projects other schools in the TOS space are doing. For instance. <a href="http://matholpc.blogspot.com/">OLPC Math</a> (yes, RIT, I'm looking at you) or <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/sliksurface/">multi-touch</a> (which is, if I recall correctly, how Seneca got started with Mozilla back in the day).</p>
<p>Synergy time? <a href="http://www.kitware.com/company/team/ibanez.html">Luis Ibanez</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~moorthy">Mukkai Krishnamoorthy</a> are TOS-ers from RPI - looking at the list of TOS-ers also turns up <a href="http://www.kitware.com/company/team/schroeder.html">Will Schroeder</a>. RCOSS has a nice (and pretty darn up-to-date!) portal page, with projects - they have great talks going on, they have courses being taught... and I'd <em>love</em> to learn more about them, and what other schools can learn from what they've done. RPI folks, what's happening in your neck of the woods these days?</p>
