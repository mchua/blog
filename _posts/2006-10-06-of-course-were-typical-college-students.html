<p>For those of you wondering what Olin is like...</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Story # 1</span><br />Last night I was walking through the dorms when Not came charging up the stairs giggling uncontrollably and waving a Playbill with an indecipherable scrawl on it. "It's his signature! I got <span style="font-style: italic;">his </span>signature!" We jumped up and down, <span style="font-style: italic;">his </span>signature and what was <span style="font-style: italic;">he </span>like and I can't believe you saw him live and such and whatnot.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Story #2</span><br />This week was Alex's 21st birthday, so to celebrate the weekend we had a tanker. 15 gallon keg in the middle of the suite, everyone filling up cheap plastic cups with beer and dancing to thudding music in a room full of hastily erected flashing lights.</p>
<p>Sounds like college, right?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Story #1</span>: The "guy" was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beno%C3%AEt_Mandelbrot">Benoit Mandelbrot</a>, father of fractal geometry, who had just appeared at the I<a href="http://www.improb.com/">g Nobel Awards.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Story #2: </span>It was a keg of root beer, complete with 6 gallons of vanilla ice cream for a root beer float party.</p>
<p>So on the one hand, yeah, it's college.<br />And on the other hand, we're definitely Olin. I love this place.</p>
