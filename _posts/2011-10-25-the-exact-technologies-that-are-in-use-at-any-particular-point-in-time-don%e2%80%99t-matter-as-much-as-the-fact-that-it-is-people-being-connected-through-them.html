<p>Blast from the past came up in #teachingopensource today, the <a href="http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Personal_learning_environment">Personal Learning Environments</a> page on <a href="http://en.wikiversity.org">Wikiversity</a>. <a href="http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:Cormaggio">Cormac Lawler</a>, you have been one of my grad school heroes since we first met in Taipei in summer of '07, and I continue to search for a dissertation project Just As Cool for my own studies. I salute you, sir.</p>
<p>Also, this quote still holds true.</p>
<blockquote><p>"...the exact technologies that are in use at any particular point in<br />
time don’t matter as much as the fact that it is people being connected<br />
through them. Tools come and go constantly, and the only constant is<br />
that the people are the important part of the equation." --D'Arcy Norman</p></blockquote>
