<p><i>I found this randomly through a book on the Unix philosophy (of all things). It struck me as - well... it struck me. Particularly the last bit of the comment by Mumon.</i></p>
<p>Joshu asked Nansen, “What is the Way?”<br />Nansen answered, “The everyday mind.”<br />Joshu asked, “Can it be studied?”<br />Nansen answered, “If you chase it, it slips away.”<br />Joshu asked, “How can I find the Way unless I know what to look for?”<br />Nansen answered, “The Way is not knowledge nor<br />
non-knowledge. Knowledge is delusion. Non-knowledge has no<br />
discrimination. When you are the Way you will have no doubt as you are<br />
free in the vast space of void. How can it be “right” and “wrong”?<br />At these words, Joshu was awakened.</p>
<p class="style3"><b><strong></strong><strong></strong></b>Mumon's comment: Joshu’s question dissolved Nansen’s answer. Even though Joshu had a realization, it must have taken thirty years to congeal.</p>
