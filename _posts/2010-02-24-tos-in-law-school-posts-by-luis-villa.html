<p>From <a href="http://tieguy.org">Luis Villa's</a> post on <a href="http://tieguy.org/blog/2010/02/24/wikis-and-law-school/">wiki usage in law school classes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In my experience, and if done well, can also teach collaboration, editing, and other writing skills. There is still a lot to learn about the ‘done well’ part, but I hope Prof. Goldman and others continue to experiment with it. They’re doing the right thing even if their students don’t realize it yet :)</p></blockquote>
<p>Worth reading. Also worth reading for engineering students frustrated and befuddled by those annoying "contract" things: <a href="http://tieguy.org/blog/2010/02/23/what-writing-a-contract-feels-like/">what writing a contract feels like</a>, explained in coding metaphors (analogy actually from <a href="http://bricoleur.org/">Alex Macgillivray</a>, but following Luis's blog is what led me there):</p>
<blockquote><p>"To put it in computer terms, imagine the contract as a computer program. In each the object is to be able to interpret the words and have that interpretation drive a result. Now imagine that there is no compiler for your program and that you can’t run any tests. All debugging must be done only theoretically and in your head."</p></blockquote>
