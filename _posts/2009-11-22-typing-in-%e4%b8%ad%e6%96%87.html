<p>如果你看这份 <a href="http://planet.fedora-zh.org/">http://planet.fedora-zh.org</a>, 对不起我的中文不足够的翻译。 我<span id="result_box" class="short_text"><span title="I will try to write Chinese when I can.">会尝</span></span><span id="result_box" class="short_text"><span title="I will try to write Chinese when I can.">试写中文时，我可以。<br />(For those reading on the Chinese planet, I am sorry my Chinese is not good enough to translate this post. I will try to write in Chinese when I can.)</p>
<p><i>For those reading on the <a href="http://planet.fedoraproject.org">English-language Planet Fedora</a>, I'm trying to learn how to participate in the Chinese-language Fedora community, and chronicling my adventures (as usual) as I go along.</i><br /></span></span><br />Kin Chew posted instructions on <a href="http://eunisim.blogspot.com/2009/11/chinese-input-editor-in-fedora-11.html">how to enable Chinese character input in Fedora 11</a> - I should screencast an F12 version now that the new release is out. But thanks to Kin Chew's instructions, I've finally started typing in Chinese - less than 5 minutes from beginning to read his post to typing 谢谢 (thank you) in a comment, including the reboot. My prior adventures in that language have all involved either dead trees or individual copy-pasting of characters from online dictionaries. Yes, it's painful; that's why my prior online output in Chinese probably numbers less than 100 characters.</p>
<p>Ah, the power of documentation. See, it's not that this was <i>hard</i> - but prior to Kin Chew's post, Chinese input was (1) something I didn't <i>need</i> to do, and was interested enough to maybe spend 10 minutes trying to figure out, and (2) something that took me more than 10 minutes to figure out, and therefore something that I <i>didn't do</i>. And I keep reminding myself that this is what it feels like for new people looking at joining the projects that I care about.</p>
<p>Next steps: figuring out how to make Chinese characters display correctly in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Terminal">GNOME Terminal</a> and <a href="http://konsole.kde.org/">Konsole</a> so I can see #fedora-zh without having to fire up xchat separately (I use irssi and screen for IRC), then figuring out how to tweak and run <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/lingobot/">lingobot</a> so I can understand #fedora-zh without having to pile through my dictionary all the time. I have a grasp of enough basic grammar that a word-for-word translation should enable me to begin squeaking by - vocabulary is my main deficiency at the moment.</p>
