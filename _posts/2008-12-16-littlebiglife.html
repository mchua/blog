<p>Reason n+1 why I love Olin people: watching George, Andrew, and James putting the finishing touches on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13GOFa1C4e4">Conway's Game of Life in LittleBigPlanet</a>. Steve-o gave me directions to his suite just in time. The sheer number of virtual wires and the amount of time it takes to fly from one end of the mechanism to the other... I believe they're showing this off at Expo today.</p>
