<p>Christoph, Wayan, Greg, Nikki, Andrea, and the Chrisses have just made me very, <em>very</em> happy. It is the tiny things that make my day: see <a href="http://www.olpcnews.com/sales_talk/g1g1_2008/give_a_velociraptor_get_a_velociraptor.html">article</a> and <a href="http://www.olpcnews.com/sales_talk/g1g1_2008/give_a_velociraptor_get_a_velociraptor.html#comments">4th comment</a>.</p>
<p>Today I am taking the unusual (for me) step of planning and prioritizing my week instead of launching in and improvising through it. (Rather, I'm trying to plan <em>just</em> enough so that I can improvise through it in my usual devil-may-care manner - I usually <em>can</em> improvise with no planning, but this week... is different, and I am struggling to learn this new habit, and <em>fast</em>.)</p>
<p>I've got 'till 3:30pm to plan my week. GO GO GO ADRENALINE RUSH GO!</p>
