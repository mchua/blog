<p>I have accepted that my parents may never understand that EMAILING IN ALL CAPS IS SHOUTING AND <font color="#66cccc">EMAILING</font> <font color="#990000">IN</font> <font color="#ff9966">ALL</font> <font color="#33cc00">CAPS</font> <font color="#ff6600">AND</font> <font color="#3333ff">DIFFERENT</font> <font color="#993399">COLORS</font> is like screaming at the top of your lungs while running around in a clown suit juggling flaming sheep. (No sheep were harmed in the making of this analogy.)</p>

<p>Discovery: getting in the habit of not volunteering to take meeting notes has considerably raised the quality of my experiences at meetings.</p>
<p>Had one of Those Moments today. It wasn't a particularly big or spectacular one, but it felt good and I <a href="http://wiki.github.com/unicefinnovation/rapidsms">helped a project move forward</a>. (Note that the stuff there isn't great, but there was nothing there before; RapidSMS is building itself as an open-source community from the ground up.) I'm not shaking from it now, but I need to sit and breathe and come out of it a little...<i></p>
<p></i>Why do I panic when I do well? Whenever I forget and let myself be great at something - not just good, but actually let-'er-rip great - and then realize it afterwards - I sometimes physically tremble uncontrollably from realizing it, and sometimes have to consciously make a decision not to let panic or tears well up. It feels like terror being fought by pride.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time fighting myself, simultaneously trying to do as well as I possibly can and then yank myself back because... well, I don't know. Allowing yourself to shine <i>is</i> terrifying. (What if your best - your real best - is still not good enough? At least this way you have "oh, I could have done better" as an excuse; it's your own willful fault rather than a shortcoming you perhaps can't fix.) I'm fairly certain that a good portion of what I've done is not the best that I could do. It's the best I can do <i>now</i>, with the ability I have to counteract this tendency.</p>
<p>I think that's why I keep coming back to this idea, and why I've written - chosen to think, I reckon - about these kinds of moments as <i>something</i> else passing through me. Dissociate that greatness from myself; I can't accomplish things like that. And on the one hand, yes, I do believe it's Someone other than me working through me. (Generally speaking, God is much cooler than I am.) And on the other hand, I <i>do</i> try to optimize my potential as a vessel, so that also makes crazy things possible.</p>
<p>Feh. I ramble now.</p>
