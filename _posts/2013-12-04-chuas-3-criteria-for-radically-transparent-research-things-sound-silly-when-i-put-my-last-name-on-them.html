<p>Aha! This is the best version so far of my criteria for <a href="http://radicallytransparentresearch.org">Radically Transparent Research</a> (website <em>really </em>needs rewriting; it's currently a mess of writing from my first year of grad school), which is basically "a methodology for producing Free Scholarship." I know, I know, there all tons of Open Research movements and projects out there; I'm trying to write an examination right now and will loop back and check in with them again <em>after </em>I pass it, ok?</p>
<ol>
<li>The work is public and freely accessible.</li>
<li>The artifacts (data, analysis, etc.) used to create the work is also public and freely accessible so that it can be studied and peer-reviewed by communities of practitioners.</li>
<li>The work and its artifacts can be freely modified and distributed so others in these communities can benefit from and build atop it.</li>
</ol>
<p>"Chua's 3 criteria for RTR" (or whatever less-silly name I can tack on that later) comes directly from a Free Culture + Academia mashup. From academic-land (specifically, the scholarship of teaching and learning), we have <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/saf/dc/readings/ShulmanCourseAnatomy.pdf">Lee Shulman’s 3 criteria for scholarship</a> (paraphrased):</p>
<ol>
<li>It is public</li>
<li>It is peer-reviewed by the practitioner’s community</li>
<li>It can be used by that community as a stepping-stone towards future work</li>
</ol>
<p>From Free Culture, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Richard Stallman's 4 criteria for software Freedom</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the connections between Shulman and Stallman? I don't imagine this is the final or best statement ever (and look forward to seeing what future version comes up), but it sounds pretty good to me right now.</p>
