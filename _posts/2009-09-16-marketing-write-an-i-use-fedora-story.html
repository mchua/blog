<p><i>Based on <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-ambassadors-list/2009-September/msg00141.html">this mailing list post</a> at Francesco Ugolini's suggestion.</i></p>
<p>After being at both the F12 release events meeting and the Marketing meeting today, I thought this might be a good opportunity for Ambassadors to help create Marketing collateral that would be useful for other Ambassadors: <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/marketing-team/ticket/12">Prepare short stories for "I use Fedora" rotations on the webpage and Fedora Insight.</a> (Fedora Insight is <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Insight">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Insight</a> - we call it FI for short.)</p>
<p>It's something that would be great for Ambassadors to do before the F12 launch (before the Beta launch, if possible) - write up <em>your</em> story about using Fedora, the stories of your friends and the people you've introduced Fedora to - and also potentially something fun to do <em>at</em> an F12 launch event; interview new users, make a podcast with them, film them describing something cool they've just discovered about their new operating system, help them write an article for FI.</p>
<p>If you write 'em, we can help you edit and publish 'em. Just link to your work <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/marketing-team/ticket/12">in a comment on that ticket</a> (you'll have to log in with your FAS credentials first) and we'll take it from there. (Yes, there will be a better workflow shortly.) There are three target dates that would be particularly great to hit:</p>
<ul>
<li>10/11 - 2 days before the Beta release of F12</li>
<li>11/08 - 2 days before the GA (final) release of F12</li>
<li>12/01 - a week before FUDCon</li>
</ul>
