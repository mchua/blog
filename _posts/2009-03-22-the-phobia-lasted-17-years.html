<p>Most of my life (and RSI-rationed typing time) this week was spent on
<ul>
<li><a href="http://lists.laptop.org/pipermail/olpc_boston/2009-March/000315.html">deployments</a> - getting people to communicate</li>
<li><a href="http://lists.laptop.org/pipermail/olpc_boston/2009-March/000321.html">deployments</a> - flashing laptops</li>
<li><a href="http://lists.laptop.org/pipermail/olpc_boston/2009-March/000342.html">deployments</a> - posting instructions,   doing training</li>
<li><a href="http://lists.laptop.org/pipermail/olpc_boston/2009-March/000349.html">deployments</a> - meetings way too early in the morning</li>
<li><a href="http://lists.laptop.org/pipermail/olpc_boston/2009-March/000350.html">deployments</a> - other things</li>
</ul>
<p>Not just CFS - visited 2 SoaS pilot sites with Caroline and have some tickets to file when I can type again tomorrow...</p>
<p>In other news, my immune system has declared war on spring (yay allergies) and I have my first jazz jam session in 14 hours. Jason Rock also made my day with a first mockup of <a href="http://git.sugarlabs.org/projects/multiply">multiply</a> - see the feedback that he's gotten, starting <a href="http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/fourthgrademath/2009-March/000109.html">here</a> with Frederick.</p>
<p>Hands in pain, typed too much writing all the CFS updates... need replacement for next week's notes. Bedtime.</p>

<p>Today was full of win. I played music with other people and did not freak out. Tonight, <br />
  however, typing is not an option. Dasher is slow, but rocks.</p>
<div class="youtube-video"><object width="425" height="344" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/Cx9WYd5b8IU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Cx9WYd5b8IU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></div>
<p>I am no longer terrified of playing music with other people. Shaky and a little nervous and in need of practice, sure. But the irrational terror is gone.</p>
<p>I want more.</p>
