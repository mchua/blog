<p>Sometimes, people with public-facing positions want to interact on Facebook in two ways: using a public persona with most people (for instance a priest interacting with his parishoners), and a private persona with close family and friends.</p>
<p>One solution is to create two separate Facebook accounts, but this requires... managing two separate Facebook accounts. Another solution is to use your private Facebook account to create a page for your public persona. You can then continue to interact with your close family and friends via the private persona, and interact with everything else via the public page.</p>
<p>But what happens when the public-facing part of your persona wants to interact in non-public ways on Facebook? For instance, what if a priest wants to join a temporary, private Facebook group for members of his parish going on a pilgrimage with him?</p>
<p>Jeff Moore and I investigated this, and the results of our experiments are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The "private persona" -- that is, one's normal account -- continues to be a normal account; it can join private/secret groups, post on the personal profiles of friends, and so forth.</li>
<li>The "public persona" -- that is, the page -- can be followed (in lieu of being friended) and send/receive messages as if it were a separate account. Cool! This resolves the vast majority of use-cases.</li>
<li><strong>The "public persona" can create public events, and converse with others inside that event using the public persona.</strong> (screenshot below: Jeff's public event for his diaconate ordination, hosted by his public persona, which is a Facebook page. Jeff is commenting under his public persona within the event, and the drop-down indicator for choosing between private/public personas is circled.)<br />

<li><strong>However, the "public persona" cannot join a group,</strong> regardless of whether it is open, closed, or secret, and regardless of whether the "private persona" is a member of that group. (screenshot below: Jeff's UI for a Facebook group, with no option to choose between public and private personas; the space that used to be the drop-down indicator for choosing between private/public personas is circled -- note that the image is a bit confusing because it includes the previous image within it... pay attention to the bottom right circle, because th other circle is a screen capture.)<br />

<li>For what it's worth, the "public persona" also cannot post on the personal pages of other accounts.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To summarize:</strong> Pages appear to be built for others to interact with, not built to interact with others. Public personas built as pages within personal/private accounts allow for private messaging as the private persona, but do not allow for group interaction, private or not. <strong>If you need to have specific group interactions, especially private group interactions, as your public persona, you need to use something other than Facebook.</strong></p>
<p>This is the best we can tell based on limited experiments. Experiments were a joint effort between myself and Jeff; the writeup (and any errors in it) are mine alone. Corrections, addendums, etc. are absolutely welcome!</p>
