<p><a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemailtwohundred.html">Strongbad is wrong</a>. Pouring Mountain Dew on an XO's keyboard is highly unlikely to make it (1) shoot sparks or (2) break. (Thanks to <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Sethwoodworth">Seth</a> for the tip!)</p>
<p>I also now know what type of <a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/cpurrin1/notebookadvice.htm">notebook-writing pens</a> to get next, thanks to Jerzy.</p>
<p>And then there's this new addition to my feed reader - an <a href="http://alannashaikh.blogspot.com/">international development blog</a> I got from <a href="http://chriswaterguy.livejournal.com/">Chris</a>.</p>
<p>I should restart reading varied random things for edification and to share with other people. Hrm. Currently halfway through a book on adolescent psychology that runs counter to my own views on the topic (I like these kinds of books a lot; when rationally and calmly written, they make me consider topics from a different angle).</p>
<p>I have a sound recorder! I'm going to use it heavily over the next few days, carrying it around beside my paper-notebook to get used to taking (and listening to) notes in audio. Part of my self-imposed ear training. Remember, Mel: you're not <i>completely</i> deaf. Recalibrate those expectations of what you can do with non-visual communication. They're probably better than you think they are. Or maybe they're worse. We don't know; we're just making assumptions.</p>
<p>Let's find out.</p>
