<p>After sleeping (really, I went to the gym with an empty stomach and no hydration and proceeded to run my fastest mile time of the year (8 minutes and some number of seconds I was too tired to remember) while feeling like absolute physical shit: side stitches and physical/mental exhaustion causing a lower-than-usual level of exertion, a sloppy stride, and patterns of muscular tension (mostly in my neck) that I occasionally, tiredly, remembered to relax.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this, but it's interesting to note that my physical best several months ago -- after hiking across England but before I started dancing and hitting the gym on a frequent and regular basis -- pales in comparison to my physical... way-less-than-best now.</p>
<p>I think I'm going to respond to that by drinking a lot of water to wash down my extremely healthy lunch and scheduling an afternoon nap into my day. Writing! Writing! I feel this massive flywheel turning; ideas are spinning out, if only I can type enough to capture them!</p>
