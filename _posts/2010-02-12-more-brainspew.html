<p>Yesterday: transparency fail. Workwise, I ended up spending the entire day working in private backchannels - I tend to have a strong habit of pushing things to open upstreams, but it wasn't enough to overcome the friction this time. On the up side, netbooks came! And today was <em>much</em> better in terms of doing things transparently. Much.</p>
<p>My aunt and I were talking about SoaS deployment roles when we realized that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix">RACI</a> (which I was introduced to by my team at Red Hat) is identical to Quaker decision-making methods.</p>
<p>Watching "Sid the Science Kid" with Audrey made me realize (the episode was on "reversible change") that one of the things I subconsciously ask myself when making a decision is "is this change reversible?" or "am I replaceable?" - two ways of asking the same question. If I get hit by a bus, somebody else can run Fedora Marketing. But nobody else can be Jason's sister. But that's what it's about, right? You pass the bus/raptor test as much as you can for everything you can so you can focus on the stuff that you <em>can't</em> be replaced for, if the shit hits the fan. It also makes me reluctant to put myself in positions where I <em>won't</em> be replaceable.</p>
<p>Today - right now, to be specific - has been a good reminder that even when I'm a good vessel, I still need to buckle down and be a good workhorse sometimes. A lot of swarming pieces came together today, and I spent it in flow state between work stuff, opensource.com stuff, grand challenges stuff, Olin stuff... the kind of momentum-building and convergence I can't explain, but just... feels... right. And now I'm looking at all the followup I ought to do on all of that and feeling very good, and very tired. Good-kind-of-tired. I'll try to explain more, maybe tomorrow when I'm actually awake.</p>
<p>Before I wake up, I must sleep. Before I sleep, I must finish the Marketing SOPs and send out a bunch of emails and and and and and. And I need to pace myself because once I start driving on Sunday morning I will <em>not get any rest</em> until approximately April 10. (And I am so, so looking forward to that.)</p>
<p>This is me writing when I'm tired.</p>
