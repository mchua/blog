<p>Good lord my happy puppy enthusiasm goes to 11 today. "Newplacenewpeopleawesomeprojectsohboyohboyohboyohboy YAYYYY!!!!" Must occasionally remember to breathe. Red Hat intern orientation is over now, and I'm starting to Get Stuff Done (TM). More on this later when I emerge from today's meetings with a better sense of what exactly I'm doing.</p>
<p>It's great to be catching up with everything I've missed from being computer-crippled from RSI. Granted, I'm catching up slowly, since I'm still limiting my keyboard usage so I don't have a relapse. But I finally got to see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50394334@N00/sets/72157618264065620/">Gary's pictures from SugarCamp Paris</a> (it looks like great fun! I wish I'd been there - I miss everyone!) and listen to <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/320/5872/62/DC1">Diana's chaos variation mp3s</a> all the way through. I haven't yet refreshed my memory on <a href="http://lahelper.sourceforge.net/mini_latex_tutorial.html">LaTeX</a> or <a href="http://decafbad.net/projects/scribus-tutorial">Scribus</a>, but when I figure out projects I have to do anyway that I can make Better Looking Through Good Typography, that problem will be solved.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I will continue to approximate an overjoyed corgi who's learned how to type at 130wpm.</p>
