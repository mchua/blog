<p>Life accelerating in the exciting-hat direction, so look - sentence fragments, semi-coherent bullet-style points!</p>
<p>Bernie pointed out that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software">FLOSS</a> <a href="http://sugarlabs.org">Sugar</a> is another term for <a href="http://cornucopiasnax.com/cottoncandy/FlossSugar-by-the-carton.gif">cotton candy</a>, and Caroline suggested standing in front of edtech conferences with a cotton candy machine for viral marketing. Starting to work on getting <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Summer_of_Code">SL GsoC students</a> <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick">SoaS pilots</a> near them.</p>
<p>Red Hat's Westford office has a <i>gym</i>. (Okay, the Raleigh office has <a href="http://www.steelcase.com/na/walkstation_products.aspx?f=30670">these babies</a>, which are arguably cooler, but... but...) I am now trying to figure out how to utilize this to make my shoulder muscles Less Fantastically Awful.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/%7Eprabhu/Projects/FOSSEducation">OSS education projects in India</a>. Rockin'. And the <a href="http://rapidsms.org/wiki/Face2FaceMeeting">first face-to-face meeting</a> for RapidSMS is tomorrow, so I'm curious how that's going to work out.</p>
<p>I've already posted about <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2009/06/02/the-posse-advances-forth/">POSSE</a>. (Multiple times. With great excitement.) And now breakfast-time is over and it's time for me to get back to work on that. Whee!</p>
