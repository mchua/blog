<p>I have to write a little bit before I start the day, because these are the things I want to think about right now:</p>
<p>A <a href="http://eskemp.livejournal.com/13449.html">lovely post</a> on Bill Watterson, growing up, and keeping a sense of wonder. (It's in a different tone than what I'd write, of course - much angrier - but pointing out that a grown man <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">still</span> (Edit: not even "still," as if this were unusual. He <em>did.</em>) managed to capture that sense of childhood - <em>yes.</em>)</p>
<p>"Do not ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive, and then go do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive." - Howard Thurman</p>
<p>And finally, I am - right now, as of this morning - sitting in the Hacker Amoeba in the garden at 1cc, the place where the OLPC developers sit. My friends and coworkers cleared a desk here for me last night (I should have asked much earlier). I remember starting to volunteer a few years back, looking at the group on this end of the office, hoping that <em>someday</em> I would be cool enough to sit there, with some of the most wonderful engineers and makers I love and admire most in all the world. Now I am here.</p>
<p>In this, I am content.</p>
