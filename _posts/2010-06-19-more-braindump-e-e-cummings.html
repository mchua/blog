<p>Yeah, the corniness factor of this quote is higher than I'm comfortable with, but I ran across it reading today and wanted to remember it, so I'm putting it here.</p>
<blockquote><p>"To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best to make you into everybody else, means to fight the hardest human battle ever and to never stop fighting." -- e. e. cummings</p></blockquote>
<p>The hard part (for me) is being able to keep you head clear on what that self is, could be, should be - there are so many pressures sometimes that I'm not sure where or who a thought is coming from any more, or whether I actually believe something I'm saying. Authorship unclear. It's why I took a gap year after college; too many voices. And it's far better now, but it's still hard to step back and listen because so often I <i>can't</i> stop running and be still enough to see the forest for the trees.</p>
<p>So I run myself hard so that I become <i>so</i> tired that at some point I can force my fatigue to overcome my habit of adrenaline. I can then make the choice to rest - and when I rest, then I can think for snatches. That's why I'll often have giant spurts of rambly introspective blog posts shortly after a scarcity of posts (most of them saying something like "ZOMG SO HOSED"). I write and think quickly because I rest quickly and with great intensity - I'm essentially either collapsing or "WHEEEEEEEEE!" at any given point in time (much more frequently the latter). I've been learning a slightly calmer middle ground ("wheeeeeeeeeee!") over the past N years, but it takes effort <i>not</i> to expend that much energy, and I'd rather use that energy to <i>do</i> stuff rather than rein myself in from doing stuff.</p>
<p>I'm starting to learn how to rest before I get to the collapse point. Burnout has taught me some hard lessons in the past few years; it's been over a year since I last had to learn one. </p>
<p>On a completely different note: I still have fantasies of someday actually redoing my website, so for when that day comes, I should look at <a href="http://www.kompozer.net/features.php">KompoZer</a>, <a href="http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/">bluefish</a>, and <a href="http://www.seamonkey-project.org/">SeaMonkey</a>. Mm. And... LaTeX, I want to get back to LaTeX, and try the awesome window manager, and... yeah. The hacks queue up, for sure. They're not a backlog, but an idea queue... I've always got something cool to do at any given point in time. Another fun thing I want to look at some point - but my car takes priority - is <a href="http://bicycletutor.com/">bicycletutor.com</a>. </p>
<p>Guitar and exercise and Mandarin. I want to make sure I pick them up again next week - I've been extremely spotty this week. Balance and recalibration. I'm actually proud that I even <i>remembered</i> that I wanted to do them this week - and I did play a little guitar, but not deliberate practice... and I exercised a bit, and did no Mandarin at all. Well. The first thing is remembering what you're trying to do... I'll get better at this.</p>
