<p>I didn't Roger did - congrats, Roger!) so it's time to crack out the ol' thinking cap and find myself another way to get there. I reckon $1,200 should do the trick - that's all for transportation, by the way, planes and taxis... need to ask my family if I can unroll my sleeping bag on their couches.</p>
<p>Also need to find a local coordinator, a location, and food donations for the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Curriculum_Jam_Manila">Manila Curriculum Jam</a>. If you're in the area or know anyone who might be interested (or know someone who might be interested), holler! We're looking for teachers, students, and people interested in creating educational materials for the <a href="http://laptop.org">One Laptop Per Child</a> project. If you're interested in finding out what we're about or lending a hand in helping us do it (giving every kid in the world the power to teach themselves anything they want to know), a Jam is a fantastic way to get started.</p>
<p>I've been spending the last 5 days sleeping on various couches in the area (Lauren's, Matt's, my aunt Lynne May's, and the floor in the back corner room of the OLPC office between 5 and 7:30am one morning) and I am <span style="font-style: italic;">so happy to have wireless back again.</span> My apologies to people I was supposed to communicate with this weekend... maybe I should pay for internet on my phone?</p>
<p>Also, thanks to my aunt Joji, a recipe for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tim Neng.</span> It's a sort of Asian quiche - tasty. I'll need to hit Super 88 to get ingredients and make this at some point.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">How To Make Tim Neng</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ingredients:</span><br />1/2 lb ground pork<br />1/4 lb shrimp, chopped<br />1 pc dried shitake mushroom. chopped<br />1 clove garlic, chopped<br />salt & pepper to taste<br />4 pcs eggs, beaten + water mixture (1:1 ratio, but add a bit more water if you want a softer Tim Neng)<br />spring onions, chopped (for topping)</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Instructions:</span></span><br />Saute garlic until fragrant. Add pork, mushroom, shrimp and continue to saute until cooked. (about 10 mins). Add salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p>Put all sauteed ingredients in a big soup bowl or pyrex (or an 8x8 cake pan, or anything else you can heat and cook in). Pour egg/water mixture into the meat mixture; it will soak through and surround them (you don't need to mix). Sprinkle the chopped spring onions on top.</p>
<p>Steam for 45 minutes or until eggs are fully set. The easiest way to do this is to set the bowl of eggs into the middle of a shallow pot of boiling water; make sure the boiling water is shallow enough that it doesn't spill into the eggs - there should only be boiling water between the inside of the pot and the outside of the bowl of eggs. (And remember to cover the container you're steaming in.)</p>
<p>Dig in!</p>
