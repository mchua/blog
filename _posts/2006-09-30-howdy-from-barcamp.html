<p>Went to bed 3am. Woke up 3:30am. Drove to NYC (with much thanks to Becky, Ben, who drove from 5-7am as I dozed in the back, and Kevin, who lent us his GPS and prevented us getting horribly lost).</p>
<p>It is now 10AM and I'm sitting on a stylish lime-green sofa in Microsoft's headquarters in NYC next to Becky and Ben. We're at <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampNYC2">Barcamp</a>, an unconference and the reason behind our insomnia driving spree.  It's a quasi-random gathering of techies from the area hanging out and teaching each other things - the rule is that if you attend, you've got to present. So the three of us are running a discussion on "Spreading the meme: how people get into hacking and how we can get more." We're n00bs, after all, so we know how to talk about others like us.</p>
<p>More updates to come, I'm sure.</p>
