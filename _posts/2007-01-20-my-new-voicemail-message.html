<p>Some things that vaguely swim to the forefront of my consciousness once in a while, and that I'm keeping my eyes open on in case I find a way to deal with them.</p>
<p>First, my "deaf accent." I know it exists, even if I can't hear it. It makes my voice very recognizable and slightly puzzling to folks who at first can't figure out what accent it is. I'm not ashamed of it and I don't want to pretend to be somebody I'm not, but I want to be able to recognize, understand, and control it so I can reassure myself that the way I sound won't get in the way of what I'm saying. Someday, I tell myself, I will go see a speech therapist. Someday when I can afford one.</p>
<p>The habits I've picked up that make me look hearing. I do them by reflex and not to deceive, but they're still vestigial in some way. I'll laugh when I'm in a crowd that's laughing even if I don't get the joke. I purse my lips and pretend to whistle when I'm dancing around the kitchen cooking, although this is absurd since I can neither whistle nor hear whistles. Nodding in agreement to complaints about crying babies, ringing phones, or middle-school flute practices in the next room that I can't hear. Saying "beep!" at the same time the microwave chimes its "I'm done!" sound, even though I've never heard a beep come from a microwave. Funny, the things a kid picks up. They've got no apparent purpose other than being what everyone else does.</p>
<p>Finally, I don't want to force everyone to adapt to my habits, but I don't want to keep asking my mom, my roommates, my aunt, or random strangers I happen to be next to on the street to tell me what my voicemail messages say. So I'm waiting a week to make sure the decision is sane, but this is what my new voicemail message is going to be.</p>
<blockquote><p>You've reached the phone of Mel Chua. Please do <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span>leave a message after the beep unless you have to, because it's hard for me to hear them so I may not be able to get back to you. If you could do me a favor instead and text message this number or send an email to voicemail at mel chua dot com, I'll get back to you right away.  Thanks for understanding, and remember - please don't leave a message after the beep!</p></blockquote>
