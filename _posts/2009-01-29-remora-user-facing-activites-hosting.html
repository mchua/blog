<p>(Gah. I posted a better, longer version of this, and then something went funny with Wordpress, and I think I overwrote it. Anyway...)</p>
<p>Heads-up on one thing I'm working on: Wade, David, andTomeu caught me up on the <a href="http://sugarlabs.org/go/ActivityTeam/Remora_port">Remora port</a>, which is a Sugar Labs ActivityTeam project working to use the software behind <a class="external free" title="http://addons.mozilla.org" rel="nofollow" href="http://addons.mozilla.org/">http://addons.mozilla.org</a> as a Activities user-facing infrastructure for installation, reviews, and ratings of <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Activity_bundles">.xo bundles</a>. I'm looking forward to hanging out with the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/WellyNZTesters">Welly testers</a> this weekend, and this is something they need so that we can migrate their Activity test results upstream to Sugar Labs.</p>
<p>The Remora port is still a small project, but Wade says it's the biggest crucial blocker to the ActivityTeam moving forward. We could use some php/mysql wizards to define and hack on <a href="http://dev.sugarlabs.org/query?status=accepted&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;component=activities.sugarlabs.org&amp;order=priority&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=milestone">tickets</a> for this, and weâ€™ll need user-facing testers soon. There are <a href="http://sugarlabs.org/go/ActivityTeam/Remora_port#Participate">instructions up on how to help</a>, or feel free to poke me / holler with questions. I have <a href="http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/sugar-devel/2009-January/011223.html">some questions of my own</a> about it.</p>
