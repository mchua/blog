<p>This morning I had a 3:50am wakeup, 6:10am flight from CA to NC,   and was <em>really excited</em> when I landed. Why? The start of <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_2009">POSSE</a>. (Recap: weeklong bootcamp at Red Hat teaching professors how to get their classes to contribute to open source for credit.) We're twittering at <a href="http://twitter.com/posse2009">http://twitter.com/posse2009</a> for those of you you who want realtime updates and like twitter, and hanging out in #teachingopensource-posse on Freenode if you want extremely realtime updates and like IRC.</p>
<p>Finally met Max in person! <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Have yet to meet Ian Weller face-to-face</span>Apparently neither Ian nor I sleep; we met at 2am. It was nice to put faces to names for all the POSSE profs - Chris and Dave sound different in person than on the phone. I was quiet most of tonight as I assimilated the way everyone talked - takes a while for me to buid a Markov model of new voices well enough to contribute to a group discussion. Some neat things that came up at dinner:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wpi.edu">WPI</a> teaches a <a href="http://www.htdp.org/">HTDP</a> camp to high school teachers every summer and certifies them to teach HTDP classes to their students. The kicker: if a high school student takes a HTDP class from a certified teacher, they get credit at WPI. Smart move, especially now that the <a href="http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/195948.html">AP CS test has been discontinued</a>.</p>
<p>Textbooks cost students inane amounts of money; we've known this for a while, but the economic crunch is helping to turn things towards open textbooks. <a href="http://jadud.com/MCJ.html">Matt Jadud</a> presented an interesting economic model for open source textbooks and an explanation of the value-add of good editing/indexing/design. Also discussed: open textbooks as an attractive feature universities can advertise. "Come here, and you'll never have to buy a textbook in 4 years."</p>
<p>Three reasons OSS makes sense in universities (and not just in CS departments, as <a href="http://www.nccu.edu/Academics/sc/business/CIS/facultyBios/seay.cfm">Cameron Seay</a> was quick to point out):</p>
<ol>
<li>it makes economic sense - gratis!</li>
<li>the Real World uses open source; when you graduate, the chance you'll work on/with OSS projects and products is high and growing</li>
<li>we need to teach students how to work on large, distributed, international, complex, jump-into-the-middle-of-someone-else's-work projects. (Even <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/abegel/">Andrew Begel</a> from Microsoft Research acknowledges this.) If you've never worked on a team larger than 3 people, never worked on a project with more than 10 files... how are you supposed to function?</li>
</ol>
<p>Me, I stuffed myself with peppers, calamari, artichoke dip, ostrich, risotto, red wine, and asparagus, and learned a lot. Always good to spend time surrounded by people smarter than you, and this week will be fantasticaly full of that. My role this week will default to "ethnographer" - I plan on taking notes as copiously as my hands (and other duties) will allow.</p>
