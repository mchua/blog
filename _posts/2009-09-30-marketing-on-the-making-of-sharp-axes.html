<p>With every passing <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Marketing_meetings">marketing meeting</a>, I become more and more convinced that Fedora 12 is the cycle where Marketing will take off - we've been coiling to spring for quite a while now, and everything is falling into place for a series of takeoffs that will culminate in Marketing hackfestingness at <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:Toronto_2009">FUDCon Toronto</a>. Abe Lincoln once said "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe." We're almost done making the axes, and it looks like they'll start out <i>preeeeetty</i> decently sharp.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Insight">zikula as a platform to work from</a> and <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Marketing_research">marketing research</a> to help us figure out where to aim, we're actually starting to gather and build an infrastructure and a set of tools for Doing Marketing, dramatically increasing our Capacity to Create Cool Content by making it far easier to do so. Recent news:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robyn Bergeron has been <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Marketing_research">driving the creation of a real marketing research plan</a> - including (finally) getting limesurvey up in infrastructure. w00t for use-cases driving new technology adoption!</li>
<li>Chaitanya Mehandru continues to keep us all in the loop with the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FWN/Beats/Marketing">FWN Marketing beat</a> and a dedication to continuously improving it, week by week.</li>
<li>Pascal Calarco and Dale Bewley have <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-marketing-list/2009-September/msg00168.html">set the wheels in motion for transitioning FWN to the FI platform.</a></li>
<li>Jonathan Roberts has <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-marketing-list/2009-September/msg00145.html">started to scout for potential marketing authors by reading Planet.</a></li>
<li>Paul Johnson has <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-marketing-list/2009-September/msg00170.html">stepped up as our interim FI editor in chief</a> and will be wielding his experienced editorial-fu to drive excellent content through FI from launch 'till FUDCon (when we'll be sitting down to figure out how we want to do the longer-term workflow gameplan).</li>
<li>Simon Birtwistle continues to push <a href="http://publictest6.fedoraproject.org/zikula/">our publictest FI sandbox</a> closer to "100% production-deployable," with a lot of packaging/review help from Toshio Kuratomi and Rahul Sundaram - and it sounds like the Docs team has been packaging wysiwyg we might be able to use as well!</li>
</ul>
<p>...and that's just from this afternoon. Yep. We have momentum! I am <i>psyched</i>.</p>
