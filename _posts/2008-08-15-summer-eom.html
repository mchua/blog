<p>Hooray! The summer's ending! I'm free!</p>
<p><i>Finally</i>,   the summer's ending. I'm going to collapse and sleep now.</p>
<p>Crud, the summer's ending. Too much to do. Too much to do. How am I going to get it done?</p>
<p>Hooray! The summer's ending! The load's going to be gone from my shoulders soon.</p>
<p>Aah! How did the summer end so fast? Where did it go?</p>
<p><i>Nononononono peopleleaving staystaystaystaystaystay</i></p>
<p>Hooray! The summer's ending! I'm going off to do more exciting things! See exciting places! Meet exciting people! Work on exciting projects!</p>
<p>There'll be another summer next year.</p>
<p>Hey, ripe blackberries. Hello, fall.</p>
