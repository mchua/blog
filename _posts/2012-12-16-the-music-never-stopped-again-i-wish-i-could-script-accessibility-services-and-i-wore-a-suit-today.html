<p>I could not initially remember <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2011/04/10/a-desperate-attempt-to-keep-up/">when I'd watched<em> The Music Never Stopped</em> before</a> - I saw it again tonight,   this time with subtitles in my parents' living room. But then I thought: wait, that's why I write. It scrapbooks memories. And sure enough, April 2011, Washington DC:</p>
<blockquote><p>...we met in the middle and walked around the flowering trees right after a thunderstorm with a bottle of San Pellegrino in my backpack. That evening, we watched <em>The Music Never Stopped</em>, which is <em>ridiculously </em>hard to find in theaters. I’m usually not a movie person because I struggle to understand the dialogue (mmm, deafness) when filmmakers decide to do things like reaction shots and voiceovers that prevent me from lipreading. However, when (1) it’s about <em>neuroscience</em> (it’s based on an essay by Oliver Sacks) and (2) features Beatles music and (3) you’re watching it with someone who’ll fill you in with dialogue after the movie, <a href="http://blog.sdziallas.com/49052685">it <em>is </em>an experience</a>. It just has to be done the right way. And yes, the trees were beautiful...</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm sitting in the kitchen post-movie writing emails to line up accessibility services for spring semester. It's one of the little things I wish I didn't have to do. It would be nice if there could be a default setting I could script in ("For all classes larger than 8 students, I would like in-person CART") and have that just show up at the start of the semester -- no meetings, no classes, no monthly check-in emails, no taking my documentation ("here's my audiogram to prove I'm deaf") back and forth, et cetera. The DRC folks at Purdue are wonderful and I know they'll make things as smooth as possible for me, so I'm not worried -- I just want to get this in for the spring semester before the start of term rush hits, and I hope I'm almost done with paperwork and going back and forth to make sure that accessibility-fu will be... done.</p>
<p>My clothes are somewhere in a stack of stuff that, until several hours ago, was jammed into the back of the minivan. Therefore, when I woke up this morning and was told we had a classy lunchtime invitation with some family friends, I had the option of wearing the dance sweatpants and college sweater I wore to haul boxes out of my apartment yesterday... or whatever was in my closet, which was... a suit.</p>
<p>It was not as bad as I thought it would be. The suit plus the haircut actually looks pretty... good. And... and I'm getting... new shoes. I'm... oh no, what's happening to me? I'm growing up into a woman gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuughhhhhh</p>
<p>No, but seriously, this "clothing that fits" thing? If they're high-quality and rugged and allow for full range of motion and all my usual criteria? They... they look good! They feel good! I'm so glad I'm almost done with clothes-and-things shopping because I want to get back to wearing whatever's on the top of the pile every morning! (It's just that it's going to be a different pile -- one with fitted argyle sweaters that go over collared shirts and slacks instead of tech conference t-shirts and identical ripped jeans.)</p>
<p>Now if you'll excuse me, I must go upstairs to read myself a bedtime story next to my baby blanket and stuffed dog. (I really am.)</p>
