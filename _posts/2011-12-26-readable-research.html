<p>I want to go back and reply to all the comments on my lit review and research proposal roughs -- that's in the queue, Stephen, Heidi, Steve, Caryn, Greg, Ben, Ruth, and more); I've been turning your comments around in my head and they've been incredibly helpful. It's mostly that my brain needs a little bit of time to do something else before it can get back to those particular items with renewed vigor.</p>
<p>On the "something else" subject, I've been reading this winter break, and have been rediscovering an affinity for... I'm not sure what to call them. "Readable Research" books, perhaps -- titles like <em>Good To Great</em> by Jim Collins, <em>Flow</em> by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, <em>Freakonomics</em> by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, <em>Spark</em> by Sir Ken Robinson, <em>Five Minds for the Future</em> by Howard Gardner, <em>Why We Do What We Do</em> by Edward Deci, <em>The Tipping Point</em> by Malcolm Gladwell... these cover a wide range of fields, but the common thread is that they are...</p>
<ol>
<li>Written (or co-authored) by researchers with a deep history in the field's subject matter. These folks aren't rehashing summaries from interviews with other experts; they <em>are</em> the experts, and the subtle effect this has on the thoughtfulness and depth of synthesis of the ideas is (at least to me) detectable. (I could, perhaps, try this with a double-blind study on myself; it could be the placebo effect.)</li>
<li>Written engagingly and well. It's not something you plod through because the content is excellent (Piaget, I love you, but your writing drives me batshit insane); it's something you relish because the writing is excellent. <em>And</em> the content is excellent.</li>
<li>Written for laypeople - a curious high school student could get through it with a little help from Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Grounded in a <em>wealth</em> of solid research - dense with pointers to empirical evidence, with conjectures clearly stated and few in number. With citations everywhere, so you can track the original papers down. I love looking through the bibliographies of Readable Research books; they're like treasure troves, veins of gold. I'm starting to try using these to get a sense of where and how good researchers track and follow information in their field.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I don't imagine that any of the books give you "deep knowledge" in a field. But they do allow you to step into the mental footsteps of those who do . When the writing is good and the reading is done correctly, there are moments of <em>holy cow this is what it's like to think that way</em>. To have all these facts and ideas at your fingertips so that an insight catalyzes flashes of connections, swiftly weaves out into a beautiful glowing web of understanding... you won't be able to reproduce it, but you'll see a glimpse of the mastery you're aiming for.</p>
<p>It's almost as if you were a pianist and could have your hands possessed by the ghost of Artur Rubenstein for a single run-through of a single song, or a martial artist who found themselves transported as a watcher in the body of Bruce Lee as he executed a perfect flying kick -- feeling what they feel, thinking what they think, but with the master remaining in control.</p>
<p>When I can write one of these, I will consider myself to have become a mature scholar.</p>
