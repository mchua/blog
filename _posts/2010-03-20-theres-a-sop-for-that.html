<p>During the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Marketing_FAD_2010">Marketing FAD</a>, one thing that came up was "boy, the Red Hat video team is awesome. I wish we had a team like that in Fedora." Especially when ideas like this come up.</p>
<blockquote><p>19:12 <b>&lt; rbergeron&gt;</b> but there's also no like... "if you want to organize a <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon">fudcon</a> and you've never attended... here's what to REALLY expect / want"<br />19:13 <b>&lt; ke4qqq&gt;</b> mchua wrote a sop for that<br />19:13 <b>&lt; mchua&gt;</b> It's like the Apple commercial. "There's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOP">SOP</a> for that."<br />19:13 <b>&lt; ke4qqq&gt;</b> mchua: we should do a commercial like that!!!!!<br />19:15 <b>&lt; mchua&gt;</b> ke4qqq: "Want to learn how to get a <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Press_kit">press kit</a> out for your FOSS project? Make a <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Remix">remix</a> for your college? <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon_organization_process">Run a conference</a> using only free and open tools? <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Category:Marketing_SOPs">There's a SOP for that.</a>"<br />19:15 <b>&lt; ke4qqq&gt;</b> mchua: yes - we need to run with that</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone feel like filming? ;-)</p>
