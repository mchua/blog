<p>Had a fantastic Indian buffet lunch with Mo and several members of the Desktop crew today,   and conversation turned to the Fedora website. It seems like the work to be done in that area is still a little... fuzzily defined, at least to me. One of the things about being a newbie is that you've got a lot of things to dive into and understand, and sometimes it's a while before you can coherently express the things you're learning in words.</p>
<p>But hey, who needs words when you've got whiteboards, Jessy's camera, and The GIMP?</p>

<p>Interpretation left as an exercise to the reader. I'm curious what thoughts people have on the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org">fedoraproject.org</a> website experience and how it could get better.</p>
