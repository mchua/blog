<p>Due to the impending <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org">Sugar</a> 0.84 release and the need to have a simple answer to the question "does build X work?" Colin, Elsa, and I came up with the beginnings of a <a href="http://sugarlabs.org/go/Smoke_test">smoke test procedure</a> over dinner on Thursday. This is meant to be a &lt;20min sanity check for developers to make sure nothing horrible has exploded, and to verify that the build is functional enough to go on to more in-depth (and interesting) testing. It can also be used to verify that your new development/testing environment has been set up correctly, or as a quick (but boring) intro to Sugar's basic functionality.</p>
<p>This smoke test only tests Sugar. It uses some Activities in Glucose to verify basic sugar functionalities, but it does not smoke test that Glucose Activities themselves work; we'd encourage Activity maintainers to make smoke tests for their Activities. We even started a <a href="http://sugarlabs.org/go/Creating_a_smoke_test">howto write smoke tests</a>, which will improve as we read other howtos on doing the same thing.</p>
<p>As you can see, these are still drafts and have just gotten to the point where they're first usable. Edits/comments/criticism/help welcomed, both regarding the tests and the format they're listed on in the wiki. (Cross-linking of features and tests to keep track of coverage is somewhat onerous right now, but I can't think of a simpler way yet.)</p>
<p>Work on this will continue; I'll be running these smoke tests myself on Monday and Tuesday during <a href="http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/sugar-devel/2009-February/011970.html">QA Party Time</a>. One thing we're in desperate need of is a link to step-by-step "here's how to set up to test our latest build" directions. Can someone point us in the direction of whatever is considered canonical for this release?</p>
