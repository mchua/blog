<p>Dr. Seuss's <a href="http://www.teamhope.com/seuss.htm">"Oh, the Places You'll Go!"</a> is one of my favorite books ever. Seuss, in general,   is awesome; I wrote a math paper in college entirely in Seussian style once, and I am still quite proud of it.[0]</p>
<p>There's one part of the book that gets me, though.</p>
<blockquote><p>And will you succeed?<br />
Yes! You will, indeed!<br />
(98 and ¾ percent guaranteed.)</p></blockquote>
<p>I'd usually go "yep, those are great odds!" But right now, I'm going <em>wait, what, only?</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Kid, you’ll move mountains!</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep. Just need the chance to move 'em. It has been a long month, but we are <em>almost</em> there.</p>
<p>[0] Other homework highlights of my college career include the continuing saga of Fritz the Homework Penguin as was featured on the margins of each of my freshman year math problem sets, as well as when I handed in my first Partial Differential Equations assignment on a mobius strip (because Burt had been jokingly complaining about having to flip back and forth between sides of a page when checking through a long series of equations). (Years later, he still had my homework hanging in his office.) However, I received equally fascinating assignments to grade as a TA, including the ModCon lab that was done as an interpretative dance.</p>
