<p>Speaking of tools which don't get in your way...</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.launchy.net/images/screenshot_firefox.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 412px; height: 75px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screenshot_firefox.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><a href="http://www.launchy.net/">http://www.launchy.net/</a> (screenshot taken from this page too.) Windows-only, but Mac folks will recognize the Quicksilver-like tendencies. Basically, press Alt-space and this little dude pops up; start typing the name of the program you want to run or the file you want to open (you can set the directories you want Launchy to look in) and whoop, up it pops. No Start > All Programs > Adobe > Photoshop > Blah > Blahblah > Blahblahblah clicking.</p>
<p>I've been using it for all of 2 minutes, and I'm completely sold.</p>
