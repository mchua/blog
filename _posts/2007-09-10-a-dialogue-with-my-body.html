<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Me: Good morning.<br />Body: Good morning! You're up early. And - oh, water. Thanks.<br />Me: *glug-glug-glug*<br />Body: That was good. What's the agen- wait, what are you doing?<br />Me: It's called running.<br />Body: I'm moving.<br />Me: I know.<br />Body: I don't do running.<br />Me: You do this morning.<br />Body: I'm supposed to <i>read!</i> At a <i>desk! </i>I - what's going on? AAH! Respiratory system! Respiratory system!<br />Me: It's called homeostasis. Get over it.<br />Body: But what's this <i>stuff</i> that's coming into my <i>lungs?</i><br />Me: Oxygen. Remember oxygen? It's much less efficient to be anaerobic. Ever heard of something called ATP?<br />Body: I can look it up on Wikipedia.<br />Me: You do that.</p>
<p><quiet></p>
<p>Body: Done reading. You're still doing this "running" thing. I'm going to make your legs hurt.<br />Me: Yeah, I know.<br />Body: They're not used to this. You're going to have to stop.<br />Me: Eventually.<br />Body: Lactic acid! C'mon, my little H+ friends!<br />Me: Eh, mild discomfort. Lactic acid actually doesn't cause muscle soreness, you know. That's a common misconcep-<br />Body: MORE! MORE! BURN! BURN!<br />Me: Oh, come off it. I'm not going to overdo it. I'm just running at a bit of a clip for 20 minutes, with occasional walk breaks. I'm out of shape - spent the last month far too immobile. Remember how you sprinted 3km through the streets of Taiwan to get your suitcase without getting out of breath?<br />Body: Yes? Almost? Distant memory?<br />Me: Could you do it now?<br />Body: No?<br />Me: Exactly.<br />Body: Why do you <i>care?</i><br />Me: Because taking care of yourself is good. And not-moving has correlated with me feeling really scattered and sluggish for the last 5 weeks. <i>And</i> because I want to learn tai chi, and that's a lot easier when you can, y'know, do more than 50 squats in a row.<br />Body: So you're going to do this again?<br />Me: That's the idea. Right, so we're done. Shower, lunch, some reading, and then let's do some crunches!<br />Body: ...<br />Me: Let's go!<br />Body: *grumble* I know I'll be happy about this in a month, but I really don't like you right now.<br />Me: Aww, I love you too.<br /></quiet></div>
