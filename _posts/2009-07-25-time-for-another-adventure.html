<p>What are we doing to do today, Brain? The same thing we do every day, Pinky. *cue theme music*</p>
<ol>
<li>Photograph and send NECC receipts</li>
<li>File (and photograph and send) this trip's receipts so far</li>
<li>Go on my traditional "I'm In A New City! Let's Take A Bookstores Tour!" tour</li>
<li>...ending at Duke's campus</li>
<li>...and possibly a jazz club if I can actually find one tonight.</li>
</ol>
<p>And then the second shift of "Mel stays awake extra as long as the majority of people sleep":
<ol>
<li>Back up my laptop (mostly done)</li>
<li>Wipe out my laptop and install Sebastian's F11-based POSSE spin instead. Yep, I'm going to be using the POSSE spin as my OS until F12 comes out - if we're going to be giving this to students, I'd better know what you can do with our default set of cool things, so we can come up with a cooler v.1.1 with a better default set of cool things.</li>
<li>Reconfigure my laptop.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have some thoughts on the latter that I should actually ask the Fedora community about. Posting there in a moment.</p>
