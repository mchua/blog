<p>The <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_RIT">POSSE RIT</a> <a href="http://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/teachingopensource/2010-06-15/teachingopensource.2010-06-15-19.15.html">IRC logs for the day</a> have possibly the most thorough set of notes I've ever taken detailing usage of <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>. I <i>think </i>they are detailed enough that a reader with no exposure to Bugzilla could use them to walk through Bugzilla usage in the context active FOSS contribution. (Although I'm equally positive that they are incomplete in some way.) I haven't seen any resources like this out there yet (how <i>does</i> a ticket tracker fit into the workflow of an actual project?) and think this may make for a good addition to something like the <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/Textbook_Project">Textbook</a> - if an editor is willing to sprint with me on this, I'll block out an hour or two on IRC to "push this patch upstream," so to speak.</p>
<p>Thanks to Andrea Hickerson for nudging me, via her remote presence, to actually take good notes today - I hope Antonio Mondragon's remote presence tomorrow will do the same. Remotees keep me honest about "upstreaming" our conversations and our notes to the broader community, where more people can benefit from them in - including us, the original participants in the conversation, since we'll get to hear more thoughts and feedback from more people.</p>
<p>Speaking of Andrea, professors of Journalism, English, Technical Writing, and so forth may be interested in the <a href="http://andreahickerson.blogspot.com/2010/06/posse-day2-and-3.html?showComment=1276743532276#c9145381446246023163">comment</a> I left on her blog post from today, which points to several projects that she might want to look at for her students to join (complete with "join" URLs, mailing list info, and individual names and links to contact information from folks I think are good starting points within those communities). </p>
