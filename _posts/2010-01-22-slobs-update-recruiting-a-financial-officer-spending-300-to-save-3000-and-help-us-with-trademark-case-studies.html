<p>First, a non-SLOBs update: a number of us (led by Walter) are working on a <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/2010_DML_proposal">grant proposal</a> for the <a href="http://dmlcompetition.net/">MacArthur Foundation's Digital Media and Learning Competition.</a> It's due at the end of the day - if you have a moment to <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/2010_DML_proposal">read</a> or <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/index.php?title=2010_DML_proposal&amp;action=edit">edit</a> or <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/index.php?title=Talk:2010_DML_proposal&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">comment</a> on the proposal, we'd greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>Now: what's up with SLOBs?<br /><b><br />Finances: </p>
<p></b>Walter has written <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board/Meeting_Minutes-2010-01-22#Finances">more notes on the state of our finances</a>, but the short version is that we've got about $7000 USD discretionary funds and <i>really </i>need someone who's <i>not</i> on the board to step up and be our financial officer for... well, ideally, a year, but I'd be happy with an interim volunteer for 2-3 months, which would give us time to figure out a better long-term solution. Email slobs AT lists DOT sugarlabs DOT org if you're interested or know someone who might be.<br /><b><br />Infrastructure:</b></p>
<p>We approved $300 for <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board/Meeting_Minutes-2010-01-22#Wikipedia_servers">shipping of Wikipedia's server donations</a> - and since those machines stand a good chance of letting us not <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board/Meeting_Minutes-2010-01-22#New_server">need to buy a $3000 machine</a>, we deferred the motion to spend $3000 on that (the Infrastructure team will re-request the funding if it turns out that the Wikipedia server donations don't remove this need after all).<br /><b><br />Trademark:</b></p>
<p>We're moving forward on the trademark process - here's a <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board/Meeting_Minutes-2010-01-22#Trademark">background briefing on the current state of our progress</a> on it, and we appreciate everyone's patience (and simultaneously, everyone's impatience, as it keeps us moving forward!)</p>
<p>You can help us with the next step, which is generating <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Talk:Sugar_Labs/Governance/Trademark#Trademark_case_studies">trademark case studies</a>. There are instructions on the page on how to contribute - the wiki page we're editing is called <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Trademark_case_studies">[[Trademark case studies]]</a>. As I write this, the page is still a stub, but Sean Daly will be filling it in with a template and examples and instructions on how to contribute shortly (but feel free to leave notes and links there anyway in the absence of those instructions - we could use data to put through that process once Sean puts the process up).</p>
<p>That's it - Walter should be posting meeting minutes/logs shortly.</p>
