<p>I <a href="http://rwmj.wordpress.com/2010/08/04/usb-hardware-random-number-generator/">ran across this</a> on <a href="http://planet.fedoraproject.org">Planet Fedora</a> and thought some Oliners (particularly ECEs such as myself) might appreciate the documentation of a random-number-generating USB key device called the <a href="http://www.entropykey.co.uk/">Entropy Key.</a> I thought it was a nifty "oooo, <i>that's</i> how it works" writeup.</p>
<blockquote><p> The Entropy Key uses <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/P-N_junction">P-N  semiconductor junctions</a> <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Zener_breakdown">reverse biased</a> with a high enough voltage to bring them near to, but not  beyond, <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Avalanche_breakdown">breakdown</a> in order to generate noise.  In other words, it has a pair of devices  that are wired up in such a way that as a high potential is applied  across them, where electrons do not normally flow in this direction and  would be blocked, the high voltage compresses the semiconduction gap  sufficiently that the occasional stray electron will <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling">quantum tunnel</a> through the P-N junction. (This is sometimes referred to as  avalanche noise.)  When this happens is unpredictable, and the  occurrence of these events is what the Entropy Key measures.</p>
<p>These noise generators are then coupled to a 72MHz <a href="http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/">ARM Cortex-M3  CPU</a> on the device.  This processor samples the generators at a high  frequency, forming a stream of random bytes.  These streams of bytes are then analyzed using <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.45.1911">Ueli Maurer’s universal test for random bit generators</a> whereby the  amount of entropy in the streams is estimated rather conservatively.   The streams are also exclusive-ORed together and that stream’s entropy  is estimated in the same manner.  If the raw streams appear to have  severely reduced entropy then it indicates a fault in that generator, if the third stream has low entropy then it indicates that the generators  have correlated and are not independently gathering entropy.  Any of  those three states are considered a failure mode and will result in the  eKey locking itself out of the host, returning only an error code  instead of generating entropy packets.</p>
<p>The two raw streams are then processed further in a de-biasing  process invented by John von Neumann.  Their entropy is estimated after  the de-biasing process has been performed.  Again, if the estimated  entropy in the streams is seen to vary too wildly at this stage, the  Entropy Key will lock itself out.  The processed streams are then mixed  into a pool made with a secure hashing function.  Once at least 50% more (estimated) entropy has been mixed into the pool than it could possibly hold it is finalised and another pool initialised.  Once enough pools  have been processed to fill 20000 bits, the totality is subjected to the tests stipulated in <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/FIPS_140-2">FIPS  140-2</a>.  These tests produce a PASS/FAIL indicator for the block.  On its own, this is not useful, since a perfectly random block could quite plausibly fail the tests.  The Entropy Key therefore keeps running  statistics on the FIPS 140-2 tests and will lock itself out if the ratio of failed blocks to passed blocks rises above a conservative estimate  of the statistical likelihood of failure.</p>
<p>Once the block has been analysed, regardless of its PASS/FAIL  indication, it is chopped up into 32 byte packets and these are handed  off to the protocol handler in the device.  Through this process  therefore, each 256 bit block of data handed to the host was formed from somewhere in the region of between 3000 and 5000 bits read from the generators. </p>

<p>This has been your geeky moment of the day. (Or if you're lucky, one of many. ;-) Carry on.</p>
