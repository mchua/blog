<p><a href="http://swirlinglight.wordpress.com/2009/12/20/coding-as-a-tool/">This is it.</a> Hari's response to reading <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2009/12/20/how-i-read-books/">my blog post on reading</a> after our long conversation about open source (and life, and many other things) last week, which was part of a long string of similar conversations we've had over the last few years, is <i>exactly</i> what I'm trying to see more of, to understand - what makes that "aha!" moment click?</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. <b>YES!</b></p></blockquote>
<p>The trick is in not giving up before you get to Yes - and also in asking questions so that you learn something new from each No. If I can upgrade my question-asking abilities so that I can, on average, go through <i>fewer</i> No's before hitting the Yes, then that is For Teh Winz.</p>
<p>You know one place I can learn how to do this? Grad school. Grad school! Grad school! Must finish application <i>now</i>.</p>
