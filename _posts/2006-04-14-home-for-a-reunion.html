<p>I feel asleep on the pool cover last night and was roused from my sleep by a 9-year-old asking me how to use earrings to kill somebody and a 2-year old bellowing "YOU'RE FUNNY!" and promptly climbing on top of my stomach to play.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Lim-Chua family reunion! Where my mother and her 7 sisters, <span style="font-style: italic;">her</span> mother, uncle,   sister-in-law, their son, his wife, and <span style="font-style: italic;">everybody's </span>kids crowd into our house and necessitate at least a half-hour wait to use any bathroom - and we have four bathrooms. We're from all over; Canada, Seattle, Boston, Chicago, Manila, Shanghai. Everyone likes food.</p>
<p>I'll be back at Olin on Monday.</p>
