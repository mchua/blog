<p><i>Written in part to show a glimpse of process, and in part to allow people who know how to write better press releases to help fix this one.</i></p>
<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_release">press release</a> is a "written or recorded communication directed at members of the news media for the purpose of announcing something claimed as having news value. Typically, they are mailed, faxed, or e-mailed to assignment editors at newspapers, magazines, radio stations, television stations, and/or television networks... the aim of which is to attract favorable media attention... A news release provides reporters with the basics they need to develop a news story." In other words, it's one way professional PR folks Spread The Word.</p>
<p>I'm going to illustrate this by example. <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ianweller">Ian Weller</a> created a first draft of the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ianweller/Creative_Commons_press_release">"we're CC-BY-SA licensed!" press release</a>. To see what's happened to it since, <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AIanweller%2FCreative_Commons_press_release&amp;diff=122672&amp;oldid=121815">look here</a>, and then read on; here's how I <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-docs-list/2009-September/msg00000.html">explained my edits on the mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>I added:</p>
<ul>
<li>The standard "this is a press release!" headers ("FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE", location/date before the body text)</li>
<li>A headline (Fedora Project relicenses content to CC-BY-SA)</li>
<li> A boilerplate snip of org info at the bottom, yanked from http://fedoraproject.org/</li>
<li>A shiny quote from Ian (this just in from IRC)</li>
<li>A contact info section</li>
<li>### at the bottom, which is PRspeak for "end of press release"</li>
</ul>
<p>The press release above still needs:
<ul>
<li>filling in of contact information at the bottom - Marketing folks, how we want to handle press releases is probably something we want to figure out in general at some point.</li>
<li>copyediting (I suck at making sure spelling/grammar/etc is 100% correct; my quick pass usually gets things to 90-95%)</li>
<li>more nice quotes from folks like Paul or Eric or Karsten - something like... "This relicensing effort will enable us to $list_of_awesomeness, we'd like to thank $these_people," said $name, $impressive-sounding-title. "$shiny_media_soundbite!"</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully this helps explain things a bit. For an example of a beautifully finished press release, check out the <a href="http://www.redhat.com/about/news/prarchive/2009/fedora11.html">Fedora 11 press release</a>, which is professionally done, and you'll see all these elements in there. It's not magic - it's just PR. ;-)</p>
