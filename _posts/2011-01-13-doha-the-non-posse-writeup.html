<p>There are still some finishing notes on POSSE Doha to write up, so it's not like there's much else that we can do (he's looking  into airline frequent flier mile optimizations as I blog; it's a form of  geekiness that makes me simultaneously roll my eyes and grin).</p>
<p>Our first dinner with the POSSE professor attendees was in an old  marketplace that had been converted into modern restaurants but kept the  old village-style architecture. Turns out the Asian Cup (soccer) is in  Doha this week, so the entire city was covered with soccer logos,  posters, mascots, televisions showing the games, and costumed mascots  walking down the street next to our outdoor dinner table. We ate the  best hummus I've ever had, talked about classroom techniques, swapped  open source culture stories for academic culture ones, and had a great  time hearing about higher education in the Middle East from Affan and  Saquib, who have a keen sense of how to hack the systems they teach  within. I also got a bowl of lamb stew that was approximately 0.2m^3 in  volume (no exaggeration; I measured its dimensions) and was unable to  finish my meal, which is unusual given my typically large early-twenties  appetite.</p>
<p>There hasn't been much other than work lately, but the work has been fun  - watching the beautiful buildings go by from our taxi in the middle of  the night when we first landed, driving by the (gorgeous) waterfront  view everyday on our way to Carnegie Mellon's campus in Qatar (CMUQ),  enjoying CMUQ's campus in Education City and taking pictures by the  person-sized sculpture of the world "Learn" on the lawn.</p>
<p>Decidedly  non-work but <em>completely awesome</em>: a brief personal/anti-jetlag  weekend stay  at the W before diving into POSSE. When Sebastian (out of habit) asked  if a complimentary upgrade was available and waved his  frequent-traveler-magic-hotel-points card at the front desk, they said  that all their rooms were booked due to the Asian Cup and apologized  that they could only upgrade us to the two-bedroom apartment... which  turns out to be the most expensive room in the entire building, with a  stunning kitchen, living room, three (three!) bathrooms,  floor-to-ceiling windows, a small office nook, complimentary breakfast  and fast internet, and... we tried later to find out how much it would  actually have cost us (we paid for a normal cheapo room), and could not  find this price online. However, the one-bedroom apartment was over  $1200 USD per night. I think my jaw dropped every time I walked into the  room. I do not know when (if ever) I will stay in a place that nice  again.</p>
<p>We've been attempting to balance hard work and good relaxation here;  Sebastian and I have been cranking out a lot of solid Teaching Open  Source stuff, but also prioritized sleep, never skipped breakfast, set  dinner as non-work conversation time, and asked the taxi to stop by the  waterfront on the way to the airport for a bit, where we finally shot  some pictures and counted ourselves as "having seen Doha," even if it  was for 15 minutes from a security checkpoint on a pier under  construction. ("Shortest vacation ever," I joked.) I'm actually pretty  proud of how we managed that balance - it took a lot of discussion  throughout, and there are still definitely a lot of rough edges to work  on (like handling expenses/financial-tracking), but that's what the  future's for.</p>
<p>Check-in to Dubai is finally open. Hitting the road!</p>
