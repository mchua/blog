<p>I'm writing this post in part for the lecturers at <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_APAC">POSSE APAC</a>, because I want them to see what a great resource blogs can be. This is what I've seen on <a href="http://planet.fedoraproject.org">Planet Fedora</a> this morning. (Again - POSSE APAC folks - none of this was planned. <em>All of this is normal</em>. This what we do in open source <em>every day</em>.)</p>

<li><a href="http://iquaid.org">Karsten Wade</a> wrote a <a href="http://iquaid.org/2009/11/09/hey-marketeers-look-over-here/">call for participation</a> for open marketing pointing people towards the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Marketing">Fedora Marketing team</a> - as the Fedora Marketing lead, I've been struggling for a while with the question of how to explain what we do to people with Marketing backgrounds in a way that will make them want to come and help out, and here Karsten's gone and done a better job than I ever could. Yay, Karsten!</li>
<li><a href="http://smoogespace.blogspot.com">Stephen Smoogen</a> made a <a href="http://smoogespace.blogspot.com/2009/11/it-musings.html">Batman and Superman analogy</a> that made me think about the difference between the sysadmin and developer mindsets. Having grown up more on the developer side of things (in engineering school, you tend to learn how to make New Stuff rather than maintain Existing Services), it's sometimes hard for me to imagine that anybody dealing with Technical Things would ever need to have a different mindset than RADICAL EXPERIMENTATION EVERYWHERE!!! - but lurking in #fedora-admin started giving me the idea that actually, no, there's a different way of thinking about things, and it's quite valuable to be able to do both. Now I'm trying to learn both.</li>
<li><a href="http://mjg59.livejournal.com">Matthew Garrett</a> wrote what is possibly the <a href="http://mjg59.livejournal.com/117532.html">first post on ACPI I have ever understood</a> - I've been interested (just out of curiosity) in learning about power management for several years, ever since I was an electrical engineering student, but nothing really made sense. I kept reading anyway. And today, for whatever reason, reading his blog post made something go <em>click</em>. I still don't understand power management, but I've understood <em>something</em> about power management, and for me, that's a huge start in being able to explore an unfamiliar topic. (POSSE folks: see - this is being productively lost, right here.)</li>
<li><a href="http://chitlesh.wordpress.com">Chitlesh Goorah</a> sent out a <a href="http://chitlesh.wordpress.com/2009/11/09/fel-need-more-rpm-packagers/">call for packaging help</a> at the same time as Zhang Xinyi and Ye Long began working on the Spins webpage for FEL. They've just checked out the code and are starting to edit it as I type this - even the call of "lunch is served!" isn't persuading them to leave the keyboard. :) (For that matter, same with me.) For me, this is a neat "many hands make light work" moment - two university teachers, new to the Fedora community, are finding a way to help with the project of a person they have never met. That's pretty awesome.</li>
</ol>
<p>...and that's just a few. And I can read this kind of stuff <em>every day</em>. And learn from people smarter than me every day. That's pretty awesome.</p>
