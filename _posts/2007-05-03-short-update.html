<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I'm treating myself to a blog post over dinner because I've had a wonderfully productive day. I have three minutes to write this as my dinner nukes, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Books are expensive! Engineering textbooks are more expensive than education ones, except for the weird out-of-print education titles, which are just as bad as engineering texts.</li>
<li>I am going to need a bigger bookshelf this summer. <i>I have a bed with a slide going down to it</i>! and what we've dubbed "The Happy Mel Box" underneath (it's lofted). </li>
<li>It's in the tough times when you find out what's really important to you. Do I care about certification, or do I care about learning? Do I care about school or do I care about education? Do I grow hungry for math and engineering theory when I don't get it? Hands-on building (precision or hacking)? (Learning, education, <i>oh yes I do</i>, and mostly hacking.)</li>
<li>I don't suck at math! I think.</li>
<li>Being sick is really annoying.</li>
<li>Families are awesome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ding! Food. Back to work. If all goes well, I'll be done with two classes by the end of the night.</div>
