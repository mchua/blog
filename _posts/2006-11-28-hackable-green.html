<p>This is the <a href="http://www.magnatag.com/page/RG/RGboard.asp">biggest Gannt chart</a> I've ever seen.</p>
<p>Readers of <a href="http://makezine.com/blog/">Make: blog</a> have seen their maker's <a href="http://www.makezine.com/04/ownyourown/">bill of rights</a>, which I love. <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com">Worldchanging </a>has a great <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/005437.html">article </a>about how design for hackability is actually design for sustainability, since handy types can fix/upgrade their devices instead of tossing them when they get broken or obsolete. Sweet - I smell a change in the world.</p>
