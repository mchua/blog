<p><a href="http://www.harihareswara.net/">Sumana</a> has a nifty proposal out for Open Source Bridge: <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/proposals/320">The Second Step: HOWTO encourage open source work at for-profits</a></p>
<p>Community research - <a href="http://newmedia-eng.haifa.ac.il/?p=2671">how to predict whether a chatroom's going to stay alive</a>. This is the kind of stuff I'd like to learn how to do.</p>
<p>Via Uncle Tom, a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/magazine/07Teachers-t.html?em">scientific look at what makes good teaching</a>.</p>
<p>Found my <a href="http://www.trainingwheelsonline.com/about.html#basic">birthday present</a>, thanks to <a href="http://ekneen.com/">Liz</a>. It looks like Ginneh's going to be doing the course with me, and with luck I should have my license right around the time I turn 24. (I will wear a helmet. I will wear a helmet. I will wear a helmet at <i>all times</i>.) Actually, the class is half my birthday present; <a href="http://boston.craigslist.org/mcy/">something like this</a> is going to be the other half. Regardless of the kind of bike I get, I'm spending extra on a good helmet and a <a href="http://www.aerostich.com/aerostich-suits/roadcrafter/roadcrafter-one-piece-suit.html">ridiculous bright-yellow riding suit</a> - the kind that has reviews like <a href="http://www.aerostich.com/review/product/view/id/4183/">"yeah, I was hit by a truck and walked away."</a> I'm trying to be sensible about the risks I take; I <i>do</i> want to kitesurf and wingsuit and all that, but I also want to have a nice, full life ahead of me.</p>
<p>I'm feeling sleepy (this is <i>very</i> good - last night is the first night this week I was actually able to sleep, and I'm going to go back and be unconscious again now) and hungry (also good!) and generally mostly back to normal, which means <i>yay work yay!!!!</i> will happen again once I regain consciousness for the second time today. Yay!</p>
