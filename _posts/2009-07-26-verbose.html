<p>My output is copious because my input is limited.</p>
<p>In the absence of being able to gather in the same amount of information others do - including peripheral awareness of feedback on how I am doing - I spew out lots of output (including output about my lack of input) in the hopes of making my processes more transparent, and in the hopes that others will directly course-correct me if I'm going wrong.</p>
<p>Conciseness makes me blind. When someone can teach me to be otherwise, I'll gladly learn. 'Till then, I've set my flags to -v.</p>
