<div>Random scribbles from the margins of an old school notebook. Apparently, how signal processing (very vaguely stated) might be able to "trick out" my piano-playing experience in terms of (1) recording it and (2) understanding visually what goes on in the frequency domain. I am unconvinced that these notes were ever supposed to make sense, though.</p>
<p><em>Dynamic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companding">companding </a>based on which piano key is pressed (have a sensor under each key that activates a different audio filter). Focus on known harmonics of each note, etc... can you get a better sounding sample by focusing on the "important" bits?</em></p>
<p><em>What would it look like to overlay a spectrogram on a piano (with frequencies on the spectrogram scaled so that they lay over their respective keys)?</em></p>
<p>Reason I rediscovered this: a few days ago I touched my baby grand for the first time in ages, and the rust is just sloughing off my fingers in huge piles - when did my fingering become so clumsy and irregular stumbling down the inversions on that Schubert impromptu? How did I lose my ability to - I'm hitting roughly the right notes, but at all the wrong times (even when I'm not slowing to sightread a weird chord combo, I'm just a fraction of a second off), emphasis on the wrong notes, no flow, and things just feel slightly wrong. It's like trying to dance after having a full-length cast taken off your leg. Technically you can move all those limbs, but you really can't integrate them after such a long period of disuse. You remember the ghost of how things are supposed to be, and it makes a sharp contrast with what they're <em>not</em> right now.</p>
<p>This, by the way, is how I've felt every time I touched a piano in the past 8 years, since I stopped "really playing." Taking lessons and hitting the keys on a regular (as in, "at least once a week, usually an order of magnitude more, quite seriously" turned into "maybe every few months? if lucky? for fun?") basis.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know. Practice, or lack thereof; it happens. It hurts to see how much not playing has diminished my fluency on the keys, but it's nice to sense that there's a chance of rekindling the dying (but not dead!) embers of being able to <em>play</em> the piano. I'm incredibly shy about playing around other people, though (at least in the beginning, before I get wrapped up in playing and forget the outside world exists). I need... an 88-weighted-key keyboard, and headphones... preferably wireless ones. I don't want to subject anyone else to my rustiness. I am living with too many good musicians to force them to listen to my cacophony for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>On a side note, Tank + cello = sounds <em>really</em> good. Aaaah. I wish I could do that on <em>any</em> instrument.</p>
<p>Reckon I should pick a piece to work on rather than futzing around sightreading random things. Suggestions welcomed. It's time for a trip to the music store.</p>
<p>First though, sleep. Ability to write coherently, or organize thoughts, rapidly... degrading....</p>
