<p>This is a quick sketch of a <em>far</em> more comprehensive series of thoughts I've been swimming in for the past... I don't know how long. It's about curriculum design (or redesign). One metanarrative we sometimes say is that "faculty make the curriculum for the students" -- in other words, it's by the faculty and for the students, and those are three distinct and separate things.</p>
<p>This is a true statement. But it's not the only true statement we could make.</p>
<p>1. Curriculum is also "for the faculty" -- we teach things based on our own learning/career/etc. goals,   we assign people to instruct classes we think they'll learn from, we go into teaching and curriculum design experiences as growth opportunities for ourselves as well.</p>
<p>2. Curriculum is also "of the faculty" -- our course designs come from our prior experiences, interests, history; we bring ourselves into the room. (The same course taught by 2 professors in different sections... is not the same course at all.)</p>
<p>3. Curriculum is also "by the students" -- they give suggestions, shape the course, TA it, send feedback, set up out-of-class study sessions, pass notes around, etc.</p>
<p>4. Curriculum is also "of the students" -- they bring in hopes and dreams and aspirations, baggage, preparation and/or lack thereof, relationships, skills, temperaments, vocabulary... the classic experience of teaching 2 sections of the same course in one semester and having the sections be wildly, wildly different? That's this bit.</p>
<p>("for" and "of" and "by" all blur together, too, as you may have noticed.)</p>
<p>So basically, curriculum is by, for, and of both faculty and students -- and being willing to (at least temporarily, mentally) suspend those boundaries has intriguing implications for the student/faculty relationship/roles -- much closer to a junior/senior partnership than the usual high power-distance separation. Which is transformative for students from an empowerment and identity perspective, for faculty, for the curriculum... etc.</p>
<p>If I had to summarize about 50% of what I'm working on now, this would be it.</p>
