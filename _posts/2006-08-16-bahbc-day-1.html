<p>Day 1 of 10 in my self-imposed experimental Becoming A Hacker Boot Camp (not really a full day, actually 5.5 hours). Report back:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Living in the Real World:</span><br />Another category I added; my brain is often too far into abstract theory, so I neglect my body (I've had it for 20  years and I'm still awkward) and forget to be present in what I'm doing. Today I rode my bike for 2 hours, pausing every 20 minutes or so to read a book chapter (~7-8min) and then came home and made a (vegetarian) dinner. Oh, yeah. I'm experimenting with not eating meat this week. So far I haven't missed it at all.</p>
<p>We also have dehydrated bananas going (assuming Jason and I don't finish them all before they're done) and a soy milk making machine that's getting used several times a day now. That's one advantage of living at home; everyone here understands my craving for soy milk. It's called <span style="font-style: italic;">comfort food</span>, folks. If you grew up on soy milk and rice porridge, you'd love them too.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Random stranger:</span><br />I took a break from biking (note: Glenview is even less bike-friendly than Boston) to swing in a playground next to a Russian grandmother and her 3-year old grandson. Talked to the grandmother, as the little boy didn't yet speak English; made funny faces at the kid instead. He laughed and even waved a shy goodbye when the two went home for supper.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nontechnical book(s):</span><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1555582737">Linux and the Unix Philosophy</a> by Mike Gancarz. I belive many unix/open-source development tenets are useful in engineering and business in general, namely <span style="font-style: italic;">small is beautiful, choose portability over efficiency, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">use leverage to your advantage</span> (meaning "don't reinvent the wheel" and "build on / stitch together the work of others whenever possible").</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000280">Getting Things Done</a> by David Allen. Great theoretical system - now I just need to pick a platform to implement it on (paper? computer? web?) If anyone has suggestions for a good implementation, I'd like to hear them. Right now I'm experimenting with Webnotes on <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/">Netvibes </a>as well as <a href="http://hiveminder.com">Hiveminder</a>, but neither of them quite fits in. <a href="http://icommit.eu">iCommit </a>is promising, but requires too many mouseclicks. And none of them are exactly portable. For those of you wondering what GTD is, Merlin Mann's <a href="http://43folders.com">43folders </a>is a good place to start.</p>
<p>Started in on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131429019">The Art of UNIX Programming</a> by Eric Raymond. Didn't finish. Normally I'm a more prolific reader, but I can only read so many books in 6 - [timespent.biking + timespent.cooking + timespent.eating + timespent.helping(mom, mom.computer)] hours. Hopefully finishing this tomorrow (although Learning Python takes precedence).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Technical book:<br /></span>Almost done with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596002815">Learning Python</a>, which I started on the plane on Sunday. I'm going very slowly through this but am hoping to get through chapters 3-7 tonight (102 pgs) and finish tomorrow (80 pgs). I'm coding two projects in Python at the moment, so everything I'm picking up is being used right away.</p>
<p>I can't believe I've never used  <a href="http://docs.python.org/ref/exec.html"><span style="font-family: courier new;">exec()</span></a>before. It's insanely useful. Or at least fills a nagging "I wish there was some way to do this!" gap that formerly existed in my mind. <span style="font-style: italic;">This </span>is why I read so much, and why I need to read more.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Minor project:</span><br />Not the one I intended to finish, but I got some Trac and documentation work done for Grrlcamp (planning for a weeklong coding marathon in which we'll be building a complete open-source project from scratch. I'll holler if more information goes public.)</p>
<p>I also decided on the whole BAHBC thing, set up my laptop so I could tolerate using it (read: hooked it to a real monitor, keyboard, and mouse - I love my laptop, but I also love my spine), and started the "mom, you're not doing anything with the old desktop, are you?" plea, so it's not like it's been an entirely unproductive day.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Report card:<br /></span>A little light on practice and heavy on theory, but a good start. I like the things I'm learning from this. I need be braver at finding Random Strangers to talk to. I also need to produce Real Working Code tomorrow<span style="font-weight: bold;">. Today's grade: B+.<br /></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
