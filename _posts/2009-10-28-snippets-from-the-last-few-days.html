<p>I've been on the road and running back and forth, so here are snippets from the last few days.</p>
<p>Young-person metabolism abuse for 3 consecutive days (...heck, I do it mostly every day). Consumption of an extended 4-course English supper plate (to which I added 3 additional courses). Consumption of a Rochester Garbage Plate chased by a slice of lemon pie. Greg also did the plate + lemon pie, to the amazement of Luke, who didn't finish his. Greg also started eating salads for lunch the next day, whereas I got two bowls of soup, sushi, a jug of sweet tea...</p>
<p>Thanks to Rikki Kite for patiently reminding me to get over my "...but, but, but, <i>attention does not want!</i>" paraonia. The <a href="http://www.linuxpromagazine.com/Online/Blogs/ROSE-Blog-Rikki-s-Open-Source-Exchange/ROSE-Blog-Interviews-Red-Hat-s-Mel-Chua">interview</a> we did (over a month late due to my aforementioned paranoia) made me reflect and think about some things in an extremely helpful way.</p>
<p>Had interpreters for the first time in <i>years</i> last night at the Innovation Center mixer at RIT. It was... fascinating - I'm going to use that word because I don't know exactly what my reaction is/was, to be honest. I enjoy having the extra experiences to mull over, though. I'm - weirdly enough, it was kind of helpful and cool, but probably in different ways than you'd expect. Aah. I am not used to being somewhere they're used to accommodating folks who can't hear, and counter-compensating (or whatever you call compensating for your usual compensations) is hard because I haven't really practiced it before. I have such a hard time turning <i>off</i> my coping mechanisms; that's what happens when you've used them nonstop for 20 years.</p>
<p>Also, introversion is a funny thing, and a long drive is actually very, very fun when you have good company to talk with.</p>
<p>I said this after Karsten's, and I'll say it again after Karlie's: fresh eggs are <i>freakin' wonderful.</i> Oh, I want chickens and dogs and a cat and a garden and a piano and little kids to play with! Not to have - certainly not now - but to visit, and to borrow, and... just to see.</p>
<p>I wish I could also repeatedly borrow a car instead of buying one, but I kinda need one right now. Oh well. While I have to put up with owning a car, I might as well enjoy it and learn things. Must ping Eamon about the possibility of swapping Auto Hacking 101 lessons with Something Else lessons...</p>
