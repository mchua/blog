<p>世界正在傾訴，你聽見了嗎?</p>
<p>OH MAN. (With the help of a great many cobbled-together technological aids), I'm understanding Chinese! Yes, I'm getting way too excited about this, but look, I get hyperactive about everything, okay?</p>
<p>世界 = (shi jie - both 4th tones) means "world." The characters, individually, mean something like "era" and "divided." I had to look this one up. I'm still not sure where they got <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> from. (I'd like to think the world is more than a bunch of divided eras.)</p>
<p>正在 = (zheng zai - both 4th tones) means "is in the middle of doing." The characters, individually, mean something like "correct/righteous" "at/exist," so it's talking about an ongoing process that's positive. I had to look the two up together - I hadn't seen them in a pair before.</p>
<p>傾訴 = (qing su - 1st then 4th tone) is something related to being interested, along with the word for "announce." Together they (apparently) mean "to pour out one's heart." I had to look this one up and I'm still not entirely clear on the exact usage, but eh.</p>
<p>你 = (ni, 3rd tone) "You." Yeah, pretty simple.</p>
<p>聽見 = (ting jian, 1st then 4th tone) means "listen." The first character is an ear and a bunch of other stuff. The second character is the symbol for "eye" over one of the variants for the symbol for "person."</p>
<p>了嗎 = (le ma - no tones) make it a colloquial question.</p>
<p>So... shi jie zheng zai qing su ni ting jian le ma = World is currently pouring out its heart (and this is an awesome thing to do). You listening, dude?</p>
<p>And then we check it against the actual <a href="http://www.globalvoicesonline.org">Global Voices</a> slogan, and sure enough...</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The world is talking. Are you listening?</span></p>
