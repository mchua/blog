<p><i>I just sent this email to the Sugar on a Stick mailing list and am too tired to make it sound less like an email and more like a blog post, yet thought people should read it and see what we're up to in preparation for the impending Tuesday release of this Fedora spin.</i></p>
<p>With the impending Tuesday release of SoaS v.3 Mirabelle, we figured that a contributor portal would be a good idea.</p>
<p>Behold the draft:<a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick_Pagerevision" target="_blank"> http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/<wbr />Sugar_on_a_Stick_Pagerevision</a> (with many photo thanks to Mike Lee!)</p>
<p>The idea is that <a href="http://spins.fedoraproject.org/soas/" target="_blank">http://spins.fedoraproject.<wbr />org/soas/</a> will be the main "shiny" user page for those who simply want to learn about the<br />
project, download the image, and use it - and that the wiki page at <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick" target="_blank">http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/<wbr />Sugar_on_a_Stick</a> will be replaced by this<br />
page revision at the end of tomorrow (Monday) and serve as the main contributors portal, with the two referring to each other.</p>
<p>You may notice that four stubs remain:<br />
* <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick_deployment_process" target="_blank">http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/<wbr />Sugar_on_a_Stick_deployment_<wbr />process</a><br />
* <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick_release_process" target="_blank">http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/<wbr />Sugar_on_a_Stick_release_<wbr />process</a><br />
* <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/How_to_fix_an_Activity_bug" target="_blank">http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/<wbr />How_to_fix_an_Activity_bug</a><br />
* <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/How_to_fix_a_sugar-core_bug" target="_blank">http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/<wbr />How_to_fix_a_sugar-core_bug</a></p>
<p>Pointers to resources and/or help filling these out is super-welcome, as is feedback on the idea as a whole. I'll be looking at feedback and<br />
making the merge when I'm out work tomorrow night; we can of course make edits after that (it is a wiki, after all) but it would be nice<br />
to have something shiny-looking and shippable when the release goes out.</p>
<p>PS: As a reminder, we have our SoaS v.3 "how did we do?" review meeting on Tuesday, June 1st, in #sugar-meeting at 1900 UTC.</p>
