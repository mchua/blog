<p>The Dreyfus brothers developed their model of skill acquisition for the US Military in the 80's. It describes mastery as the process of increasing one's ability to independently improvise through a complex environment. Later, or even a senior undergraduate -- 4 years of college will not make someone an expert in their field. "Competence" is a more reasonable level to strive for -- basic proficiency that sets a new graduate up to continue learning as a junior practitioner in the working world.</p>
<p>As with the this was produced for the <a href="https://polytech.purdue.edu/">Purdue Polytechnic Institute</a> (PPI) and is open-licensed and available online (as you can see), so yes — feel free to share this with your friends however you would like.</p>
