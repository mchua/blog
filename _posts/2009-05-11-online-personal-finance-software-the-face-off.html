<p>After a year of the "keep receipts in a big folder!" methodology, based on a "we don't need no finance software!" philosophy, I've found both to be somewhat lacking. After reviewing and sifting through a blizzard of options (including libre and closed-source software, desktop and web-based, gratis and paid) I decided to limit myself to...</p>
<ol>
<li> web-based services</li>
<li>with minimal basic functionality (deal-breakers for me: secure, must get information from most of my online accounts, help me budget, and give me an easy "from X time to Y time" summary view)</li>
<li>that costs $0</li>
<li>and easily export/sync to a standard file format you can work with using other programs on your desktop (no lock-in).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Contenders:</strong><a href="http://www.mint.com/"></a></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mint.com/">Mint</a> is a spending tracker that automatically recommends products and services to you.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.clearcheckbook.com">ClearCheckbook</a> is "an online checkbook register with the added bonus of viewing reports, setting budgets, creating reminders and more."</li>
<li><a href="http://www.yodlee.com/ymc_home.shtml">Yodlee</a> is what Mint is built on top of ("that with which Mint is built on top"?).</li>
<li><a href="http://wesabe.com">Wesabe </a>is a money management tool with community features built in.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Criteria:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Does the program make me <em>feel</em> happy when I use it? (This is largely a function of thoughtful UI design.)</li>
<li>How easy is it for the program to download and use financial data from your bank, etc. accounts?Â  (best: automatic.)</li>
<li>How many of my accounts can be linked to the program, so I don't have to enter transactions in by hand? (best: all of them.)</li>
<li>Will it force me to review my finances on a regular basis? The most likely scenario for this is some sort of push communication, for instance "email me updates once a $timeperiod. (best: yes, and we'll make it compelling for you to track your progress, and as a bonus, it looks pretty.)</li>
<li>Can I check my financial status on the go? The most likely scenario for this is being able to get reports via SMS, email, and/or IM. (best: yes, and we show you all your budget category status numbers too.)</li>
<li>Can I update my financial status on the go - in a way I'll actually do it? For instance, being able to SMS in "I spent $1 on a cookie, this comes from my 'fun' budget" would fit the bill. (best: yes, and you can fill in all the fields via SMS/etc. you'd be able to fill in online, so you don't have to go back and add metadata to your transactions later.)</li>
<li>How many and which programs does the file format you export to work with? (best: yes, Mel, we work with tax preparation software...)</li>
<li>Do you import file formats from other financial programs? (Not super-important, but in case I ever switch to something else and then want to go back...)</li>
<li>Is the program smart about moving/renaming/merging/splitting/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)#Basic_operations">&lt;insert-set-operations-here&gt;</a> categories and/or tags for expenditures? (best: yes, and there's an undo.)</li>
<li>What other cool things can you show me that I haven't thought of?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The procedure</strong></p>
<p>For each service, I am going to...</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an account.</li>
<li>Link it to as many of my financial accounts as possible (savings, checking, IRA, stocks...).</li>
<li>Input (manually, with the online interface) May 2009 expenses so far.</li>
<li>Check my budget status (with the non-online interface) before taking any spending-money actions during the next week.</li>
<li>Input (manually, with the non-online interface if applicable) May 2009 expenses during the next week.</li>
<li>Review my financial status on Monday, 5/18.</li>
<li>Try out the criteria in the list above I haven't exercised yet.</li>
<li>Draw up the final ranking.</li>
<li>Make a decision.</li>
<li>Export and back up my financial data</li>
</ol>
<p>Stay tuned for the results.</p>
