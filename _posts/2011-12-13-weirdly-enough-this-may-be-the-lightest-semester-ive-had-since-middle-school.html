<p>Spring class schedules have been determined! My academic plate for the upcoming term:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedagogy, Content, and Assessment ("how to design a good class"), for which I may use the <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> curriculum as my term project.</li>
<li>Theories of Development and Engineering Thinking ("how engineers think and how people learn to think"), the class most likely to make my head hurt with unfamiliarity next semester.</li>
<li>German for Reading Knowledge II ("how to use a dictionary to read a book in German even if you don't speak the language") which I'm using as "language-learning for the mostly-deaf" to the great amusement of the German department.</li>
<li>Art and Design Research Methods ("putting rigor into creative stuff") with Shannon McMullen of Electronic and Time-Based Art, who also taught my art class this semester. Awesome. And I won't be the only Engineering Education student this time - Canek is joining me!</li>
<li>An independent study that's basically <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/User:Mchua/Olin_Institutional_Repository">implementing an Open Access policy at Olin College</a>, my undergraduate alma mater - which means I get to learn about open licensing and copyright <em>and</em> work closely with both Purdue and Olin librarians during the spring term... yay for quality time with Amy and Dee!</li>
<li>Transcript analysis of "change agents" with <a href="http://xroadsresearch.org">my research group</a>, which will be my first introduction to formal academic research. Ah, cognitive apprenticeship, how I love thee.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, that's my <em>academic</em> plate. (It used to be heavier. Then multiple people gasped in horror and talked me out of taking 7 classes at once.) And then there's the <em>nonacademic</em> plate...</p>
<p>Crawling through the end of the semester. Trying not to be a hermit. I think I really just need to get up steam for that last big final <em>push</em> - two more deliverables to go, and then... I'm getting in my car and heading west.</p>
