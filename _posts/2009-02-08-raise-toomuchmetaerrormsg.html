<p>If you're not a Python coder,   <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/errors.html">this</a> may help with the title reference.</p>

<p>“Do you always think this much, Charlie?”<br />
“Is that bad?”<br />
“Not necessarily. It’s just that sometimes people use thought to not participate in life.”<br />

“Yes.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm procrastinating on things I should be doing because I am afraid of them, and hiding out by being meta. Reflection's good, and when I use it to avoid <em>doing</em> the things I'm reflecting on, I should stop reflecting and go back to doing.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I can set up metacognitive triggers on overmetacognition. (Sometimes they work.) And then, during times like this (for instance, I am currently abusing nested parentheses (see?) and overusing the word "meta," and blogging about how I'm doing these things instead instead of going to bed, instead of going to bed) I can go "Oh, okay. I've just crossed that line. Stop."</p>

TooMuchMetaError: using thought to not participate in life
</pre>
<p>And swing back towards the other direction.</p>
<p>I'm now tired enough to be unconscious for a few hours. Sleep time.</p>
