<p>CNN Money has a neat <a href="http://cgi.money.cnn.com/tools/prioritize/prioritize_101.jsp">page </a>that lets you "rank your goals" (up to 15 of them) by pairing them up and asking you to choose between them.*</p>
<p>I was surprised that the option of having a family someday (not like I'm, but that I want to have that option if the right person comes around) ranked so highly, and that graduate school ranked so low. I suppose if I'd put "become a professor" instead it would have pulled it up some, but there are many things I value more than formal academic credentials. (Sherra Kerns tells me that I've got to at some point "pay my dues" if I want to be an engineering prof at a top-notch school. I told her yes, but that I wasn't ready to pay them right now.)</p>
<p>Anyhow, my randomly generated list, which is a rather poor approximation of what I'd actually like to do with my life... but makes for an interesting set of information anyhow.</p>

<p>*yes, I did go back and try to figure out what sorting algorithm they're using in the 5 minutes before my next meeting. My first thought was quicksort, but the big-Oh is less than n^2 log n and more than n log n. I've got to run now but I'd like to puzzle this through - I don't think it should be <span style="font-style: italic;">this</span> hard but my brain's fried from not sleeping for two weeks... any suggestions?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Big-O table, for reference</span><br /># of items : # of questions<br />2 items = 1 question<br />3 items = 3 questions<br />4 items = 6 questions<br />5 items = 10 questions<br />6 items = 15 questions<br />7 items = 21 questions<br />8 items = 28 questions<br />12 items = 66 questions</p>
