<p>So we had the FUDCon ad all finished, and from B&amp;W to color</a>. But we did it!</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/fudcon-toronto-ad1.png" /></p>
<p>...the wrong way 'round. It works this way, Chris is going to print it sideways if we need to, but in case someone wants to pick up a quick last-minute tweak, the ticket's is <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/design-team/ticket/71">#71 in the design-team queue</a>.</p>
<p>Chris notes the final file is needed by noon EDT (approx 4.5 hours from now). We are ok as-is, so this is not a PANIC NOW! ticket, more a "if you want to tweak it, noon EDT is the cutoff" note.</p>
<p><b>(in #fedora-design)</b><br />11:14:29 &lt; brejc8&gt; is that "4.25" (tall) x 5.5" (wide)" ?<br />11:16:09 &lt; brejc8&gt; mchua: do you have the widths and heights the right way round?<br />11:17:43 &lt; mchua&gt; brejc8: ...ARGH</p>
<p><b>(over in #fudcon-planning)</b><br />11:19:12 &lt; mchua&gt; ctyler: um... can you print it sideways?<br />11:19:22  * mchua should probably not inkscape in the wee hours of the morning<br />11:19:41 &lt; ctyler&gt; mchua: we could, but it might look... sideways<br />11:20:01 &lt; mchua&gt; ctyler: "adds visual interest"?<br />11:20:08  * ctyler feels really bad about the last minute changes<br />11:20:44  * mchua could add "why is this ad sideways? come to FUDCon Toronto and ask Chris Tyler to find out!"</p>
