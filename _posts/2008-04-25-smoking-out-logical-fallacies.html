<p>Something about <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2008/04/17/yet-another-internal-monologue/">what I said</a> a few days back has bothered me,   and I've struggled to elucidate it since. The best i can come up with is that I <i>always</i> have something to lose in any given situation, even as a beginner. I do deal with sustaining the state of having plenty to lose - I just don't notice when I'm doing it well.</p>
<p>When am I more aware of what I have to lose? When do I worry about it? Why? And I also note that these two things don't always coincide - in fact, a lot of what I'm trying to avoid is the crippledness brought on by worries that I'm not aware of, or don't understand the motivations behind.</p>
<p>There are still logical fallacies in this, but I'm trying to work them out - it's one of those "man, your philosophy muscles are rusty" moments, as well as "look, you need to find more than 5 continuous moments to think about this at some point" times. Perhaps on the plane tomorrow.</p>
