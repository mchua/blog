<p>This might be pretty easy to guess, but this week has been all sorts of crazy busy for me (whoa, backlog piling up) and it is also <i>awesome</i>.</p>
<p>I love teaching. Love love love love teaching. Love being in a classroom, love being in a school, love talking with professors, love talking about learning, about learning with technology, about helping students grow and about growing as a student myself - it fills me up and wears me out and makes me just... happy. At home in the center of a hurricane of motion.</p>
<p>I'm going to need to force myself to take a breather when the week is done - go home on Friday and actually sleep, and clean my room, and eat things, re-pack, take care of some stuff that <i>isn't</i> POSSE in my life (heck, some stuff that isn't work), but... mmm. I can't <i>not</i> do this. I must get better at it. Education, both in and out of the classroom, and in open communities of practice, is an art that I would like to master.</p>
<p>And that is <i>precisely</i> what I'm doing, and what I have been doing for the last several years. It's odd to think that I've been teaching for almost a decade now - I started the summer I was 15, running science and math camps with curricula I'd designed, although I didn't <i>really</i> catch the bug for another few years until my sophomore year at Olin when I became a TA. </p>
<blockquote><p>[Talking about how I had a lousy, sleep-deprived, burnout-filled week my senior year of college, but then a few folks had dropped by and talked with me about engineering education...] I was still sleep-hazed, and my eyes still burned bleary, and I swayed when I stood, but oh, I felt good! Chandra grabbed me while Ryan and Jon went back to get food. “Promise me you’ll work on something with engineering education when you get out of here?”</p>
<p>“I think I have to,” I said. It makes me come alive.</p>

<p>I don't know why. But oh, when I do it, it feels <i>so</i> good.</p>
