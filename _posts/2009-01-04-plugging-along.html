<p>Marathon road has come upon an unexpected washed-out bridge. Adjusting accordingly and scrambling not to stumble on slippery stones. Still fine, but painfully aware I'm sprinting on a knife's edge here. Exhilarating, but I'm also surprisingly calm (I'm proud of myself - I've been resisting the turbo button so far and doing ok!)</p>
<p>Also, I'm going to have to look into the differences between problem based vs project based learning soon.</p>
