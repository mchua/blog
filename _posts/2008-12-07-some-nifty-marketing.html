<p>From my parents - I thought that this was quite clever.</p>
<blockquote><p>Take a look at <a href="http://producten.hema.nl/">HEMA's product page</a>. You can't order anything, and it's in Dutch, but just wait a couple of seconds and watch what happens. Don't click on any of the products, just wait and see what happens. And be sure you have your sound turned up. <em>[Edit: Apparently things that are soft to me are very loud to other people. Whoops. Make sure you have your sound turned on, but to a more moderate volume than originally stated.]</em></p></blockquote>
<p>From Tim Smith (I agree, and think groups that want to make things that will quickly be internationally understood should take note):</p>
<blockquote><p>350.org, a climate change activist group, put together a totally sweet and basically wordless <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOAtbWHWJqk">animation</a> to describe their mission and its urgency. I think itâ€™s really well-done.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Marketing. I'm interested by <em>marketing</em>. I think I'm turning into my father in some ways - ways that are very much not such a bad thing.)</p>
