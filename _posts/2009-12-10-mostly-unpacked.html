<p>I'm unpacked from FUDcon,   but not from the move up from DC. Slowly starting to build a life in Boston - a very lightweight one, because I don't know how long I'll be here or where I'm going next. Still, permanent address is hypothetically permanent; despite multi-month (or even full-year) stints in other places, I can still call my aunt's house in Boston home. </p>

<p>Yeah, that's about right. (The mess part, too.)</p>

(Max, this blog is actually quite useful for pictorially illustrating<br />my actual energy levels when I'm exhausted but still hyperactive; thanks!)</p>
