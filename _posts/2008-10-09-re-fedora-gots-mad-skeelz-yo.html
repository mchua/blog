<blockquote><p>POINT #1: ALL THE ENTHUSIASM IN THE WORLD FAILS IF IT CAN NOT BE HARNESSED.</p>
<p>POINT #2: WE STILL DO NOT HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF FEDORA WORK ITEMS SUITABLE FOR NEWBIES -- BUT WE WILL FIX THAT.</p>
<p>This is an absolutely key problem to solve. The following scenario is one that we must avoid at all costs:</p>
<p>Newbie: I just found out that I can help this cool project called Fedora!  I'm going to go to the Fedora site to learn more!</p>
<p>(An hour of searching an inherently confusing wiki follows.)</p>
<p>Newbie: This is really hard.  I think I'll go play Freeciv instead!</p>
<p>Note: MORE WIKI PAGES DO NOT SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.</p></blockquote>
<p>Skills management. It is a problem. We are all learning how to solve it. This is  a tough question, because conventional management training (I may be speaking wrongly, as I have little formal business training and have not read every book on the subject - but I've read a lot and asked around a lot) seems to focus on how to run things when you <em>do</em> have a chain of hired command.</p>
<p>When you can't order people to do things, you have to use other ways of getting things beyond your individual capacity to happen. How do you <em>do</em> that? I'm looking at fundraising, nonprofit volunteer recruitment... these are all full-time jobs. What if you <em>have</em> a full-time job? What if you can't take that much time? What do you do?</p>
