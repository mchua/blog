<p>This would be hilarious if it weren't annoying. (Well, actually, it's still pretty amusing.) This is the street outside our hotel.</p>

<p>It's the kind of thing that, in Boston, I'd go "meh" and not even bother shoveling. However, this is North Carolina - so the TV is blaring emergency information, there's an address from the governor at 10am, there's a little ticker at the bottom of the newscast detailing how various medical facilities are closed...</p>
<p>The <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Events_FAD_2010">Events FAD</a> will consequently be convening from the meeting room in our hotel in a few minutes, once we set up our infrastructure there.</p>
<p>On the up side, we're going to be dogfooding plenty of our remote event participation tools today. Hop aboard <b>#fedora-fad</b> and join the (increasingly distributed) fun!</p>
