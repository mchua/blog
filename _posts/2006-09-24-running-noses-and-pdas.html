<p>There seems to be something going around school, because half the folks I know have been sick sometime in the last 3 weeks. This week it's my turn; I've somehow come to need 8 hours of sleep a night, have a continually running nose, and am awfully tired. Productivity has been less than stellar for the past 5 days. From prior experience, I usually feel worst about 2-3 days before I'm completely over this kind of thing, so I fully expect to be spry and running about by Wednesday. (I've also gotten considerably better at taking care of myself.)</p>
<p>Consequently, my room is in shambles again. The messiness function of my room looks a lot like a sawtooth wave. It's about to plunge back down again; I'm going on a cleaning fury right after this shower (sinuses... need... hot... steam).</p>
<p>On a completely different note, I've been toying with the idea of buying a PDA or Pocket PC (or smartphone, or something small, electronic, and personal-organizey) for a couple years; does anyone have any recommendations? I can't decide whether I want to go ultra cheap & low-tech (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_PDA">Hipster PDA</a>) or insane (<a href="http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/vanity/axim?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen">Dell Axim</a> or <a href="http://web.palm.com/">Treo </a>smartphone) or somewhere in between (<a href="http://store.palm.com/home/index.jsp">Palm</a>). I tend to be a pretty cheap person, but I'll spring for good tools that make my productivity dramatically rise.</p>
