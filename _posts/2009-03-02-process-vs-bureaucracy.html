<p>From <a href="http://alannashaikh.blogspot.com/2009/02/on-process.html">Blood and Milk</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bureaucracy, to me, is the core of an organization. It’s what keeps an organization functioning when its staff changes. Without the forms and the regulations, you don’t have an organization. You have a cult. The structures are what makes it about more than just whoever works there at the moment. Bureaucracy puts the “organize” into organization.</p>
<p>That does not mean, however that bureaucracy should rule your work. It’s supposed to help the work get done. The work does not come second. And everyone accepts that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Her distinction between bureaucracy and process seems one of goals. If I'm reading this correctly, the author is saying that process is for the sake of a structure beyond the immediate implementation, bureaucracy is metascaffolding (including process) set up for the sake of implementation success, and therein lies the difference.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate both words are sufficiently loaded in my mind that I'm unable to think as clearly as I'd like about this. Will keep a lookout for ways to fix that.</p>
