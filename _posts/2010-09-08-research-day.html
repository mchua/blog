<p>It's the little things in life that drive me nuts. The tiny, dishes to wash, laundry to fold, bathrooms to clean, renter's insurance and correcting a car rental bill and convincing a company that yes, my address <i>is</i> in Raleigh, please ship me my computer stuff. I try to minimize and streamline and automate it as much as I can, but things still slip through - particularly since I have no steady-state, no constant shipping address, none of the steadiness and settling-down most of the world assumes.</p>
<p>So today I said <i>okay, screw that</i>. I'd been craving maker time - research time, thinking time, long unbroken hours for my mind to focus on <i>one problem</i>. One hard problem. No interruptions for cooking food (I'd preemptively batch-cooked over the weekend and filled the freezer with homemade instant meals) or washing dishes (later) or folding laundry (later) or dealing with the mail (okay, I slipped and did this after dinner, but it's <i>done</i> now).</p>
<p>Today I went to the office, disregarded everything else, and thought about the POSSE curriculum. That and only that. And it felt <i>so good</i>. All the scattered, disconnected pieces that had been building up in my brain all summer flew onto the whiteboard and gradually merged into coherence - a picture I could understand, a system I can work with. I laid it out in color on a whiteboard in a meeting room, looked at it with the calm sense of assurance and quiet pride of someone who <i>knows</i> - somehow - they've done well, took a few deep breaths, and waved Max over. He looked at it in silence for a few moments, then looked at me. "Wow. This... is <i>really good.</i> I don't know what you had to do to get your brain in a state to produce this stuff, but this is <i>amazing</i>."</p>
<p>I'm going to try this again next week - next Wednesday is going to be another Research Day, my deep-thinking day, where I do <i>nothing</i> but work on one problem, one hard problem that requires mental focus and attention, all day. I won't get anything else done. Emergency email check in the morning and report-back at night, but I'm unavailable for meetings, off chat, unable to be pinged... it's <i>my</i> time to work. My time to solve the problems that I want to solve.</p>
<p>That's not to say I'm just going to force myself to work on that and burn through it no matter what. I took breaks, I ate bananas, walked around the building... when I needed to relax, I did, but POSSE was gently turning in my mind, and I did not worry about any other work, did not <i>do</i> any other work, did not stress about my backlog. Listened to music, walked on the office treadmill, drank some soup. After the relaxation came the sprints - 30 minutes of walking and then suddenly I could just <i>write</i> things and they made <i>sense</i>.</p>
<p>I came back from that tonight and felt a rising sense of frustration because - well, laundry pile, dirty dishes, envelopes on the table... I took care of some of it, but shouldn't have - I'm still finishing up my Research Day. I'm going to write up my results (which I am proud of), post them, share them, and <i>then</i> I shall call the day a wrap, and then I shall become available for other things (I do have to wash my dishes if I ever plan to eat from them again). It's still my day and my time and I'm entitled to do uninterrupted work that I am <i>proud</i> of for the day until I'm <i>done</i>.</p>
<p>It feels ridiculously satisfying, just tackling your priorities and dropping all the tiny unimportant things. Now all I have to do is get rid of the guilt.</p>
