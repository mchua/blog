<p>...I wanted to make sure that folks got a chance to see <a href="http://lmylim.wordpress.com/">Lynne May's</a> posts about the upcoming <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/category/soas/">SoaS deployment</a> - she's the classroom teacher. (Bernie's working on getting the blog on Planet, so this should be a moot point soon. Thanks, Bernie!)</p>
<blockquote><p>"I think it is important for my students to know that Sugar is based on these principles. I want them to think whether or not&nbsp; these principles are compatible with their own thinking about themselves as learners, and about learning.&nbsp; I see how these principles connect to the Quaker principles of our school. Will they?" -- from <a href="http://lmylim.wordpress.com/2010/02/11/sugar-mission-statement/">Reflections on the Sugar Mission Statement</a></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://cambridgefriendsschool.org">Cambridge Friends School</a> is a Quaker school, so it's interesting to me to see her translating our Sugar work into the values that the school already holds dear, because <i>that's</i> what they're going to think is important, that's how they're going to be able to start understanding this. It's like everything else in open source; you start with what they already care about, the itches they want to scratch, and then you find the intersections of your self-interest and theirs where it makes sense for both of you to work together.</p>
<p>There's also the <a href="http://lmylim.wordpress.com/2010/02/10/draft-of-sugar-pilot-program-proposal-at-cfs-grade-1-room-2/">Proposal draft</a>, which includes the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>The social studies curriculum for grade one room 2 will focus on<br />
communities for the rest of the school year beginning February. The<br />
students will explore three parallel communities: the school community<br />
(where they work), the neighborhood (where they live), and the Sugar<br />
Labs community (where they share ideas). In the course of this unit,<br />
the students will attempt to answer these two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What role do I play in these communities, and how do I fulfill this role?</li>
<li>What makes a community work well for me, and how could I tell if it would work well for someone else?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This has a few important framings and implications. One thing the open source world has historically had a hard time with is communicating to others how we work - how our communities work - because at first glance it sounds totally unlike anything someone from outside the open source world is used to. However, if you frame it as:
<ol>
<li>Your school is <b>where you work</b></li>
<li>Your neighborhood at home is <b>where you live</b></li>
<li>Your open source community is <b>where you share ideas</b></li>
</ol>
<p>...then <i>bam</i>, the parallels make a lot more sense. I'll also note that #3 is basically the core of the definition of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice">community of practice</a>.</p>
<p>The other exciting implication is that the work of the students is going to be <i>learning how to explain open source participation to others</i>. This is great, because...
<ol>
<li>It means they will be participating. </li>
<li>It means we will have first-graders able to explain how to participate - and if they can grok this and explain it, then by gosh <i>anyone</i> can.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that there may be a part of some people's brains that turns off when I open my mouth[0] - "Oh, you're one of those... math and... technology people... engineer... I have no hope of understanding what you're saying so I will now switch to Nod Politely Mode." But this same circuit <i>does not trigger</i> when faced with a first-grader saying basically the same thing. Because a 6 or 7 year old can't <i>possibly</i> be saying things that should go that far over your head - if they understand it, you should be able to understand it too.</p>
<p>One thing I would love to see: if we made it a practice to have every Sugar Labs presence at an event include at least 2 presenters age 12 or under. And I mean presenters - speakers, boothworkers, etc - not "we happen to be hanging around the booth while our parents work it." The kids should be running the show, with the grown-ups supporting them as loyal minions. Mmm, minions. I'm looking forward to trying this out... just need to find a nearby event so the kids (and their parents) can actually make it over there.</p>
<p>[0] Although I also think I tend to trigger this less than some of my fellow engineers - as a young minority woman, I <i>look less</i> like an engineer, which sometimes helps with getting folks to be more open-minded about the things I'm trying to say. (Hey, while the situation exists, we might as well use it to our advantage.)</p>
