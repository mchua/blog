<p>There's been a number of giant marathon-length (100+ email) threads on the Sugar Labs mailing list lately talking about the future of Sugar on a Stick (SoaS), a discussion that has stretched out to encompass everything from SL governance and project-wide decisionmaking to trademarks to new mailing lists being created to... you get the picture. </p>
<p>As you can imagine,   it's hard to keep up, and no summary can do it justice. Nevertheless, here's my attempt at picking out some highlights for folks who're wondering what the heck is going on. In mostly-chronological order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sebastian's <a href="http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/iaep/2009-September/008322.html">original open letter</a> explaining his vision of where his SoaS stands and where it's going; the email that started it all.</li>
<li>After some "why do we need to worry about any of this formal stuff?" discussion, Greg points out that <a href="http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/iaep/2009-September/008396.html">contributors need some assurance that their work is valid, too</a>.</li>
<li>Tomeu chimes in with a <a href="http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/iaep/2009-September/008389.html">sugar-core developer's point of view</a>, placing SoaS as a separate project that is an important downstream of sugar-core.</li>
<li>Mel <a href="http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/iaep/2009-September/008534.html">turns into a human ticket tracker</a> in order to keep track of the various blockers we are busting through.</li>
<li>Chris <a href="http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/iaep/2009-September/008469.html">lines up the decisions</a> that need to be made about the issue and sets them on the way to being driven forward by SLOBs <a href="http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/iaep/2009-September/008470.html">via the mechanism of a decision panel</a>.</li>
<li>Sean Daly explains <a href="http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/iaep/2009-September/008557.html">how SoaS fits into SL's marketing strategy.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/iaep/2009-September/008656.html">The latest update on the situation.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>(Think something vital is missing from this list? Think something on this list isn't actually a relevant highlight to call out? Have a better summary or a way of improving this one? Holler!)</p>
