<p>Several things of note since I last posted.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Wikimania conference  </span>- more about this later,   but suffice to say it was awesome, educational, awe-inspiring, and boy did I meet a lot of great people there. The Olin panel (thanks to Mark Chang, Debbie Chachra, Allen Downey, and Andrew Bouchard!) was nothing short of stupendous, and I kept on hearing compliments about it well into the evening and the next day. Sweet.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Work ended</span> - I loved my time at <a href="http://dcontinuum.com">Continuum</a>, and plan on visiting next year (in two weeks for a brainstorm, actually). Olin people, check this place out<span style="font-style: italic;">; </span>you'll have a great time and learn a ton, and meet some wonderful people. Aside from the obvious internships in the engineering departments (I was in the EE dept, but there were a few ME interns as well), there's also the Strategy department, which essentially does UOCD for a living.</p>
<p>I got a spiffy orange scarf and some chopsticks as a going-away present. Now <span style="font-style: italic;">that's </span>utilitarian. I use chopsticks on a not-infrequent basis, so this is a welcome alternative to the cheapo plastic sticks I'm used to.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Tax-free weekend was taken advantage of  </span>- I never thought I'd see my mom waiting in line outside a computer store at midnight, but tax-free weekend in MA sent its siren call out and we spent the afternoon - and then the night - at the Apple Store in Burlington getting a Macbook. This replaces the creaking Sony VAIO and Dell Dimension desktops downstairs. With the glory of ProCare, I no longer have to be my mom's tech support, so the midnight run was well worth it (heck, I would have done it anyway; it was fun.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. I'm home - </span>in Glenview, IL for the next two weeks. So if you're in the area and want to say hi, drop me a line. I'm technically working as a freelance coder from now 'till school starts, but I'm hoping to spend more time riding my bike around town than sitting in front of my laptop.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I'm going to go out and bike right now.</p>
