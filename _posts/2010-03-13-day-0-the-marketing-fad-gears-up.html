<p>The first-ever so I will simply link to the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Marketing_FAD_2010#Day_0:_Friday">Day 0 (Friday) blog posts</a> I've been gathering up and remind folks that we're going to be on <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/IRC">IRC</a> all day transcribing in <b>#fedora-fad</b> if you want to stop on by.</p>
<p>On the agenda for the day:
<ol>
<li>F12 postmortem</li>
<li>What are our goals and thoughts for the future, both short-term and long-term?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oletimebarbecue.com">OLE TIME BBQ</a> (om nom nom nom)</li>
<li>Marketing plan</li>
<li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Marketing_research">Market research</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hurricanes.nhl.com">CAROLINA HURRICANES</a> (wooooooooooo hockey)</li>
<li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Marketing_FAD_2010#The_optional_.27late_late_show.27">The Late Late Show</a>: David and Ryan teach everyone who's still awake how to package PHP libraries. I suspect I will be playing the role of Obsessive Documenter once again, since I learn things by documenting them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Everyone else is already up and about in the lobby, and I'm about to go join them right after I post this - I got my customary couple hours o' sleep and then woke up before my 6:30am alarm, decided to spend the morning time jogging around the shopping center parking lot (discovery: Raleigh does not have sidewalks) and looking for hearing aid batteries (success!) and now... it's time to go and join the party.</p>
<p>Rock it!</p>
