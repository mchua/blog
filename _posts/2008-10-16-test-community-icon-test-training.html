<p>Just for fun, an icon draft for the testing community is below, since it's been a while since I busted out the Inkscape and I needed to take a break somehow tonight. Edits/counterideas welcome; the source is <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Image:Olpc-testing-logo.svg">here</a>. I'm just getting this party started; I don't actually have icon design skills myself.</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/olpc-testing-logo.png" /></p>
<p>On a more serious note, a number of volunteers have expressed interest in learning testing along with me, so I'm hoping to make the community test group a great place for newbies to learn about QA. More details in the <a href="http://lists.laptop.org/pipermail/testing/2008-October/000539.html">original testing mailing list post here</a>. If you're interested, have ideas on how we can do this, or (best of all) willing to teach something you know, please let me know, either through a comment on this post or by directly responding to the testing mailing list.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's blog post will be in response to all the great feedback I've gotten on this week's posts so far. Thanks for the thoughts and helps, everybody - please keep them coming!</p>
