<p>A simultaneously disturbing and heartwarming trend: I'm becoming less nerdy over time.</p>
<p>"Less nerdy" comes with a disclaimer. Random academic snippets hop into my speech far more often; I connect more disciplines, look at desks and food and crowd behavior and think compressive loads, organic chemistry, and fluid dynamics where I wouldn't before.  I laugh at more math jokes. It sounds like I've gotten worse. But I've actually gotten better.</p>
<p>I don't like locking myself up in a room with textbooks and pencilling out abstract equations for hours any more. It's still fun, but it's not - connected. Not real. Abstract intellectualism isn't what I do any more; it's a toy, not my life. (I still like it, but it's not my life.)</p>
<p>The world, or whatever subset of it I happen to be in, is my life. Things I thought I've never get to, things like business negotiations, how to navigate delicate political situations, how to actually touch the minds of other people and <span style="font-style:italic;">change</span> things; this is what I think about more often than not. My happy physics textbooks and linguistics books and my TI-89 are tools for that cause, used like painting, speechmaking, running and modern European history are tools. They're tools for tinkering with and hopefully improving the world, not just studying it.</p>
<p>Olin, you've turned me into a renaissance geek.<br />Thank you for giving me a life.</p>
