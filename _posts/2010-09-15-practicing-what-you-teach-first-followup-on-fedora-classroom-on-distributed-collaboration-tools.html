<p>This is a followup to the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Classroom">Fedora Classroom</a> class on distributed collaboration tools I <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2010/09/07/fedora-classroom-tuesday-sep-14-at-1600-utc-working-with-people-who-arent-there-basic-distributed-collaboration-tools/">advertised teaching earlier</a> - I'm trying to show by example how to do good followup on a remote-attendance event. (Mmm, meta.) Thanks to everyone who came yesterday! I was... honestly, stunned by how well it went. Lots of participation, lots of questions, lots of insight for me to digest in terms of how to teach these things better in the future.</p>
<p>As is common for so many of us, I immediately got hosed with (unexpected!) life and (unexpected!) work <i>right</i> after running yesterday's classroom session on distributed collaboration tools. BUT: the first rule of followup is "release early, release often." Get <i>something</i> out within 24 hours, no matter what it is - perfection can come later.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Zodbot">Zodbot</a> (an IRC logging bot we covered in the session), I can send this in just a few minutes because we've already got <a href="http://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/fedora-classroom/2010-09-14/basic_distributed_collaboration_tools.2010-09-14-16.00.html">condensed notes from the session</a> - so those of you looking to find out what happened. Personally, I'd read the <a href="http://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/fedora-classroom/2010-09-14/basic_distributed_collaboration_tools.2010-09-14-16.00.log.html">full log</a> starting at the point where we <a href="http://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/fedora-classroom/2010-09-14/basic_distributed_collaboration_tools.2010-09-14-16.00.log.html#l-63">introduce the concept of Fedora Classroom</a> if you're new to Fedora, or the point where we start <a href="http://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/fedora-classroom/2010-09-14/basic_distributed_collaboration_tools.2010-09-14-16.00.log.html#l-106">talking about the dynamics of remote realtime meetings</a> if you've been around Fedora for a little while.</p>
<p>I'll be following up with longer on Thursday and individual pings for the folks who asked questions - feel free to shoot questions here in the meantime.</p>
<p><i>By the way, I timed myself... it took me exactly 8 minutes to write and post the <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/pipermail/tos/2010-September/001627.html">followup email</a> to the <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/classroom">Fedora Classroom</a> and <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/mailman/listinfo/tos">Teaching Open Source</a> lists where I'd advertised earlier, and to repurpose that text for this blog post on the <a href="http://planet.fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a> and <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/Planet">TOS planets</a>. See? Doesn't take much when you have your tools do the heavy lifting for you (thanks, Zodbot!) Actually, I'd have been done in half the time but it took another 5 minutes to put in all the links.</i></p>
