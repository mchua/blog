<p>Aaaand now that all the transcripts are in and somewhat cleaned up, here is the complete collection of <a href="http://go.eucalyptus.com/EucaDay-NYC-2012-Agenda.html">EucaDay artifacts</a>; if you wanted to know what happened during any of the Eucalyptus sessions, everything you need is below. It is all text-based so it is easy to search and translate (there are no audio or video files available). If new artifacts come in, I will update this post accordingly.</p>
<p>If you are catching up with the event now, I suggest reading the transcripts (there are two) as a primary activity since they are a live capture of what was said during the event, then opening the other artifacts (slides and videos) as they are mentioned in the transcript.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1063Nnq8VIjOY9BSbPoIUoywr9aLMvVPakScdgZ0djIw/edit">Morning transcript</a> - a running log of what was said during (and around) Marten's and Tim's presentations, including audience questions. <strong>Use this as your primary reading to catch up on the morning.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gregdekoenigsberg/eucalyptus-eucaday-201204mgm">Marten's slides (presented in the morning)</a> - Marten Mickos is the CEO of Eucalyptus, and gave an overview of where the company is and where it's headed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gregdekoenigsberg/tim-cramereucadaykeynotefinal">Tim's slides (presented in the morning)</a> - Tim Cramer is the VP of Engineering at Eucalyptus, and talked about the state of Eucalyptus technical development.</p>
<p><a href="http://meetbot.eucalyptus.com/meeting-logs/eucalyptus-meeting/2012-04-25/eucalyptus-meeting.2012-04-25-12.03.html">Morning IRC backchannel log </a>- what was being discussed on IRC during Tim and Marten's talks.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1je0wPplJY4Wut92LQxIjUT1FyGOouVXHOIeTEEUFZuQ/edit?pli=1">Afternoon transcript</a> - a running log of what was said during (and around) Greg's presentation, including audience questions, and the EucaDay wrap-up by Marten. <strong>Use this as your primary reading to catch up on the afternoon.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gregdekoenigsberg/gregdek-eucaday-nyc">Greg's slides (presented in the afternoon)</a> - Greg DeKoenigsberg is the VP of Community at Eucalyptus, and talked about why a thriving open source community is vital to Eucalyptus -- and then let community members take the floor through short filmclips.</p>
<p>Videos (shown in the afternoon) in the order they were shown:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEGj4XJdBc">Osamu Habuka on his Eucalyptus book</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqP3qHETNUc">Patrick Dunnigan on Storm</a></li>

<p>Feel free to edit and comment on any of the transcripts and artifacts -- and let us know whether this sort of event documentation is useful, and whether we should do it again!</p>
