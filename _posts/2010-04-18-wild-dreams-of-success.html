<p>Inspired by <a href="http://sachachua.com/wp/2010/04/in-my-dreams-of-wild-success/">this post by Sacha Chua.</a></p>
<p>In my wild dreams of success, I am a student - but a peculiar sort of one. I am a student of making things - that is to say,   I'm actively hacking stuff <i>and</i> being openly reflective about it - and my teachers are the students I am teaching, or whom I have taught, or the students of my students (or somewhere down that line).</p>
<p>Studying and making and hacking are things I would like to return to, and things I will come back to cyclically throughout my life. I want to build the kind of world I'd like to learn in and then be able to enjoy it - sort of the equivalent of, say, a college president retiring and then enrolling as a freshman. Maybe not quite so drastic or clear, but a similar idea. </p>
<p>I've found that I can't just relax into making (worksforme is not sufficient) until the conditions under which <i>everyone</i> is able to hack - because I want to hack with other people! - are satisfactory, and so I became a teacher and a system-shaper so that someday, maybe, I could rest. For instance, I am looking forward to being a <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Campus_Ambassadors">campus ambassador</a> - and so I've been talking a bit to <a href="http://hackersramblings.wordpress.com/">Ryan Rix</a> about building that program so it will <i>kick ass</i> by the time I arrive, and I can relax and settle into being Just Like Any Other Newbie. And I <i>so</i> look forward to being Just Another Volunteer on the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Marketing">Marketing</a> team headed by <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Rbergero">Robyn Bergeron</a> next release cycle. </p>
<p>So it's important for me to learn to be a catalyst, rather than carrying things on my shoulders ad infinitum, and it's important for me to learn how to pass the raptor/bus test, let go, move on. As long as the world isn't the one I want to live in, I will keep on changing it - until other people start to do the job. And then I will bloody well relax and enjoy it.</p>
<p>I'll worry about learning how to relax when <i>that</i> time comes. ;-)</p>
