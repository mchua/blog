<p>Just got back from giving 3 talks in 2 days at Rochester, headed to New York (update: now in New York, and it's great to see so many friends again!)</p>
<p>Many thanks to RIT for sponsoring the trip, Steve Jacobs and his family for putting me up, taking me creek-wading, and totally blowing my mind on audism, Karlie Robinson and her family for stuffing us with BBQ and great company plus a tasty farmers' market trip (also, hammocks are best used as playgrounds for 4-year-olds), and the Math4 gang for sharing their projects and learning with me and the open-source community. It was great to finally meet Fred Grose in person, too.</p>
<p>On my to-do list lately...
<ol>
<li>Work out fingerings for <i>Groovin' High</i>. RH is good so far... not happy enough with LH yet, since I have yet to come back to the piano and have the fingering for that hand still memorized. Usually that's a sign I haven't got it right, since fingerings should feel natural.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Fix the new spam flood coming to my mail account. ARRGH</li>
<li>Install Dragon Naturally Speaking. Wine didn't work. Qemu is too slow. My Thinkpad refuseth to dual-boot. I'm just going to try this on a borrowed desktop when I visit Chicago.</li>
<li>Send thank you and follow up emails from Rochester. So much awesome!</li>
<li>Write about entrepreneurial thought and action so I can send those notes out too.</li>
<li>100 push-ups and a good stretch session.</li>
<li>Project proposal, summer-related.</li>
<li>Set up summer appointments, contracts, jobs, the beginnings of a schedule.</li>
<li>Find subletters. If you know anyone who'd like a 2-bedroom in Boston for the summer, let me know!</li>
<li>Send belated rounds of thank-you presents. And when I say belated, I mean "from October."</li>
</ol>
<p>I am checking on what it would cost to make my workstation ergonomically awesome-tastic. Right now it ranges from $0 to $1500, depending on how elaborate things get (keyboard? keyboard tray? monitor mounts? piles of books propping up screens? an actual desk instead of sitting on my bed/sofa? Dumpstering for the above?) Hands improving, though - I've used my laptop for about 6 hours over the last 2 days, with very little discomfort (and lots of awareness of the discomfort so i stopped and checked it before it could turn into pain). Win!</p>
