<p>Yep, we're going back in time a little. Best conversation snip from last night's <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_2009">POSSE</a> dinner:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have to go to Best Buy. <br />Why? <br />To get a wireless router. <br />Why do you need a wireless router?<br />&lt;something about how they need to be online to do work&gt;<br />&lt;something about how don't they have internet in their  rooms?&gt; <br />Yes, but it's wired, everybody working in their own room. We  have to work <i>together.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>The best thing that I'm learning from watching these professors is how to be a good learner of the kind of stuff we're trying to teach. If you're curious what's been going on, here's the curricula from <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_2009_Monday">Monday</a> (intro to open source), <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_2009_Tuesday">Tuesday</a> (building and packaging), and <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE_2009_Wednesday">Wednesday</a> (bugzilla and reviews).</p>
<p>I've been light on transcribing for Tues and Weds since it's mostly the profs working through already-documented processes like how to make an RPM, but I would love to see their notes on the experience - not redocumenting how to, say, package - but notes on what was surprising, hard, confusing... before the "oh, of course that is the way it is" I'm-used-to-this comfort zone hits, while they still have the eyes of newcomers.</p>
