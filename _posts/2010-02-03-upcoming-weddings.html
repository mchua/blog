<p>It seems like everyone is getting hitched these days.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ultimateweddingcontest.com/entries/22435">Steve and Ryan</a> are gunning for the Ultimate Wedding contest so they can invite all their Olin buddies to the ceremony. Ryan's request for votes is what is prompting me to write this post.</p>
<p>My second cousin Achi Nono also recently got engaged to her long-term boyfriend Ian. Her real name is Elinor, since she stayed with my family while she was in college.</p>
<p>Yay and congratulations to the happy couples!</p>
