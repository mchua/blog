<p>Congratulations, Olin's class of 2008. You're probably getting sick of people saying "congratulations!" all the time, so here's a request to boost the information value (read: decrease the predictability) of this post.</p>
<p>There was a whole lot of speechifyin' today about how you, as engineers, are supposed to go out and build/invent/create/construct/make the future. My request is that you keep two words in mind while doing so: "viral" and "exponential growth." In other words, part of "building the future" is to get <em>other</em> people to build it as well - and to build it <em>their</em> way. (The corollary being if you want it to be built "your" way, you'd better make your way their way as well.)</p>
<p>Mm. Going to Commencement this year was good in that I got to see people I loved that I hadn't seen for a long time and celebrate a special rite of passage with a community that's shaped each other's lives in powerful ways. It was also good in that it gave me a sense of closure that I hadn't gotten as much during my own graduation. Last May, I was in some sense being dragged kicking and screaming out of the nest. It was still home. This time I recognized that it wasn't in a way that was more than intellectual. Olin's a place that used to be a home for me, and in some ways always will be, but it's not where I <em>am </em>now. It's the thought that "oh yes, I <em>did </em>graduate." It feels strange... and good, in a strange sort of way.</p>
