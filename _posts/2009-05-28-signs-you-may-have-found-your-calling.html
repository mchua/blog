<p>I just looked up and realized
<ol>
<li>it's dark outside</li>
<li>it's 8:15pm</li>
<li>I've been working for about 12 hours so far today, and could keep going</li>
<li>it's my first day of actual work (before was orientation)</li>
<li>I have just realized that I am Very Very Hungry (warning sign! must pay more attention to not hyperfocusing lest I destroy the good physical habits I've been trying to build!)</li>
</ol>
<p>I think it is a fairly safe conclusion to say that <i>zomg I love my summer job.</i> "Work On Projects You Care About; Occasionally Get Paid" is turning out to be... a pretty good career (non)strategy. </p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Mchua/Daily_reports/2009-05-25">what I've done so far this week at Red Hat</a> (note that since all my projects are community projects, I can and should be transparent about everything). I have pictures of stuff, too, but uploading them will have to wait until tomorrow.</p>
