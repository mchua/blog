<p>One of the greatest pleasures in life is splitting a yellow Crenshaw melon the size of your head in the grass with a pocketknife, then smothering - alternately - your face and a spoon into it, making mandatoriliy loud slurping noises as seeds and juice and melon drip every which way.</p>
<p>When you're down to the last shred of flesh and the skin is flopping around loose in your hands, you'll be holding a bowl of sweet Crenshaw juice. Then you pour <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> down your throat, down your chin and shirt, and you're done; no longer hungry or thirsty, and sticky with the smell of honey.</p>
<p>So then you move on to the strawberries...</p>
