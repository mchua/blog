<p>Please don't automatically say that I do $thing <i>despite</i> $situation.</p>
<p>I do $thing. And $situation exists. Those are the only facts we have. Please don't assume that there is a "despite" or a "because" or any other sort of causal link involved. There may be; there may not be - please try to <i>find out</i> if there is instead of jumping to conclusions.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><i>Note: I don't expect people to read or know or adhere to this or even remember all the time if they happen to read this or something like it - just noting a preference that, for now, I will continue to assume I have to bear the burden of adapting to the world for, instead of the other way around.</i></p>
