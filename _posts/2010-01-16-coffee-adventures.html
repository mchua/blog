<p>Chris Carrick took me on a tour of his favorite Boston coffeeshops today in an attempt to persuade me that coffee does not suck. I went and researched the effects of caffeine beforehand and estimate that I have had somewhere between 500-600 mg of caffeine in the span of 2 hours today; despite hydrating and eating before the journey and afterwards to try and slow the absorption-into-bloodstream, long before sleep-time. Drinking lots of water now as well to forestall (or at least slow) any headache-potential.</p>
<p><b>Round 1: <a href="http://www.tastecoffeehouse.com/">Taste</a> (Newton)</b>
<ul>
<li>expresso ("wow, it... doesn't suck!")</li>
<li>cappuccino ("fern!")</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Round 2: <a href="http://barismo.com/">Barismo</a> (Arlington)</b>
<ul>
<li>expresso (much brighter and sweeter than the first, regaled with tales of coffee travels, roasting, etc. as it brewed; they roast their own beans here and hacked their roasters to give them even more control)</li>
<li>drip coffee (the taste changes as the temperature does - fascinating)</li>
</ul>
<p>They did not have this today, but according to Chris, the best coffee in the shop is any of their Kenyan roasts, syphon-brewed.</p>
<p><b>Round 3: <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/simons-coffee-shop-cambridge">Simon's</a> (Cambridge)</b>
<ul>
<li>cappuccino (nom!)</li>
<li>mexican hot chocolate (spicy!)</li>
</ul>
<p>It was great! I learned about the different things that affect the flavor of coffee, the physics of how the funny-looking machines of various types worked. I can certainly see why people would enjoy the taste of coffee. </p>
<p>I am, however, still a tea person.</p>
