<p>Tim Hwang is <i>ridiculously</i> good at making people feel immediately included and invested in the Making of Something Wonderful. Watching him, I wonder if that's a bit like what I do when I get contagiously enthusiastic - only better, in ways I need to learn from.</p>
<p>Email really is addictive - like a slot machine with random positive reinforcement, I read once. Even after a few days of slipping, it takes effort to Turn Off Thunderbird until I just sit down and <i>write</i> this silly thing. (Later: Written! That feels good. Now I have to do another draft of it; hurrah.)</p>
<p>I agree completely with Eric Nehrlich <a href="http://www.nehrlich.com/blog/2008/12/18/buying-pants/">about pants.</a></p>
<p>Finally, my three favorite parts so far from <i>The World Is Too Much With Us</i>, the sci-fi story I've been writing on and off again for... over two years now. Some people here know the context, some don't; I'm curious what conjectures about the characters and stories people come up with based on these fragments.</p>
<p>Fragment the First:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I'd try it, if you don't mind it," Paul advised. "I used to. It takes the edge off your brain, calms it down some." After a short silence that was broken only by the sound of Emmy alternately gulping and pausing to grimace, he added: "I don't do it any more. It lets me think too straight."</p>
<p>"I miss that part," said Emmy as a wave of nausea, warmth, and a familiar fuzzy sleepiness stole over her. She drank another quick pull and fought the urge to gag. The room had a lurching inertia to it, but her mind... was... coming... back into... control... much slower and more clumsy than she was accustomed to, but settled coherence through a fog. Emmy opened another bottle, a stubby green one this time, drank again. "It tastes like sleep deprivation."</p></blockquote>
<p>Fragment the Second:</p>
<blockquote><p>"You need a better human API."</p>
<p>He stared. "You should talk. One of the unwritten rules is that you aren't supposed to state the specification."</p></blockquote>
<p>Fragement the Third:</p>
<blockquote><p>"At least you were known for that. You fit into the category of affectionate anomaly. You want it back, because it's safe for you to be a danger; you know the role well, and so do they."</p></blockquote>
