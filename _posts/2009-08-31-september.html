<p>In 1.5 hours, it will be September. September will be interesting.</p>
<p><a href="http://teddybouch.wordpress.com/">Andrew</a> and I have issued mutual challenges to each other. I find it exceedingly difficult to rest, logging between 3-5 hours of reluctant, intermittent, and often discontinuous sleep per night on average; consequently, every day this month I must get 6 consecutive hours of sleep (under extenuating circumstances, 2 stints of 3 hours each may be accepted). He has a difficult time asking for help; consequently, every day this month, he has to write a letter to somebody asking for something (it may be as simple as advice). We will keep each other accountable with daily emails.</p>
<p>We're not quite sure what this will do to us. Yay, friends! They help you be educationally masochistic!</p>
