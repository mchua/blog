<p>It is amazing how much more productive I am when I have a desk. This happened tonight; I had been previously working while sitting on my bed. And now I have a table and it's in my room and there's a chair and <i>wow</i>. Furniture... helps!</p>
<p>Went out for dinner with Jason (brother) and Mark (cousin) today, which meant I spent several hours speaking entirely in affectionate insults - a dialect I'm used to hearing, but very, very, <i>very</i> rarely speak myself. Pizza... was tasty.</p>
<p>Two last thoughts before I turn in for the night:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2009/12/21/digging-out-a-path-of-least-resistance/">Digging a downhill path</a> is like <a href="http://www.kaner.com/pdfs/bugadvoc.pdf">bug advocacy (pdf of a presentation by Cem Kaner)</a> for my brain.</li>
<li>School ought to be the view-source button for life.</li>
</ol>
