<p>In honor of my mom obtaining her dual-citizenship. It turns out that my dad can't, and the Philippines doesn't do <em>jus soli.)</em></p>
<p>After repeated (failed) attempts at getting my parents to use our new, perfectly functional dishwasher as something other than a dish rack, <a href="http://www-scf.usc.edu/~troyphi/?page=117">I'm accepting that I'm Filipino</a>. See #35. (Also, for reference, "Tagalog" is pronounced "tah-GAH-log," with the stress on the second syllable; it is not stressed on the first syllable, as that makes it sound like you are playing a children's running game with large chunks of tree.)</p>
<p>Bolded items are the ones I don't <em>quite</em> do.</p>
<ol>
<h2>Names</h2>
<li>Your middle name is your mother's maiden name. (Lim.)</li>
<li>Your parents call each other "Mommy" and "Daddy." (Occasionally "Mom" and "Dad.")</li>
<li>You have uncles and aunts named "Boy," "Girlie," or "Baby." (Yep. Auntie Baby.)</li>
<li>You have relatives whose nicknames consist of repeated syllables like "Jun-Jun," "Ling-Ling," and "Mon-Mon." (Nono, Num-num, and Tin-tin are all sisters, too.)</li>
<li>You call the parents of your friends and your own parents' friends "Tito" and "Tita." (Well, the Filipino ones, yes.)</li>
<li><strong>You have four or five names.</strong> (I think I actually escaped this one; I have a first, middle, and last name. And a nickname. And a confirmation name. And then- wait. Never mind.)</li>
<h2>Family and friends</h2>
<li>You're related to everyone. (Even when I went to Manila last January at age 21, I was <em>still</em> meeting relatives I'd never seen before... and I'd already met what seemed to be the entire population of the Philippines by that point.)</li>
<li><strong>You consider your close friends your cousins.</strong> (Kind of? I consider friends to be like family, I suppose... I dunno about this one.)</li>
<li>You greet your elders by touching their hands to your forehead. (I only mano po to Filipino relatives, but sure.)</li>
<li>You always kiss your relatives on the cheek whenever you enter or leave the room. (Old relatives, yes.)</li>
<li><strong>You follow your parents' house rules even if you are over 18.</strong> (Well... I'm supposed to. We have issues with this one.)</li>
<li><strong>You live with your parents until and at times even after you're married.</strong> (Emphatically not doing this one.)</li>
<li><strong>You make your children sing and dance to amuse your friends and relatives.</strong> (I have no children. However, I put on piano performances for visitors when I was little. It was not my favorite thing to do.)</li>
<li>You bring food to your uncles or aunties or whoever anytime you cook food.</li>
<li><strong>Your grandma wears those long dresses w/different designs at home.</strong> (My grandma tries to get me to wear dresses instead.)</li>
<li>You bring mangoes (or other produce) with you as a gift when you visit peoples homes. (Not necessarily mangoes or produce; cookies work too, and tea.)</li>
<li>Your parents never go to the movies. (They do watch bootlegged Chinese DVDs with awful subtitles.)</li>
<li>Your mom and all of her MJ friends always complain about how bad each of their children are. (Oh, yes.)</li>
<h2>Home</h2>
<li><strong>Your house has a distinctive aroma.</strong> (I don't think so, but I usually have a cold.)</li>
<li><strong>You decorate your living room wall with your family's framed diplomas and plaques. </strong>(They're displayed in the basement, actually.)</li>
<li><strong>You decorate your dining room wall with a picture of the "Last Supper." </strong>(No, but I know a lot of people who do!)</li>
<li><strong>You keep your furniture wrapped in plastic or covered with blankets.</strong> (True when I was younger. No longer true.)</li>
<li><strong>You have carpet runners in your house.</strong> (I don't think we ever did this. We certainly didn't after all the floors were replaced with hardwood.)</li>
<li>You always leave your shoes or slippers outside the doorstep.</li>
<li>You have a Sto. Nino shrine in your living room. (Yep. Funny story behind that one, too.)</li>
<li><strong>You keep a fly swatter in your kitchen.</strong> (Formerly. No longer.)</li>
<li><strong>Your kitchen table has a vinyl tablecloth.</strong> (Formerly. No longer.)</li>
<li>You recycle shopping bags as garbage bags. (Wait, doesn't everyone?)</li>
<li>You have a drawer full of old pens, most of which don't write anymore. (I'm trying to throw these out...)</li>
<li><strong>You have a piano that no one plays.</strong> (Hey, <em>I</em> play it. When I'm not visiting my parents, though...)</li>
<li><strong>You hang your clothes out to dry in a laundry line.</strong> (We live in Chicago. The weather is not amenable to this.)</li>
<li><strong>You keep a tabo in your bathroom.</strong> (No, but I think it's actually a good idea.)</li>
<li><strong>You own a barrel man from Baguio.</strong> (What?)</li>
<li>You have some kind of garden in your backyard. (Stones.)</li>
<li>You use the dishwasher as a dish rack. (Yes.)</li>
<li><strong>You have never used your dishwasher.</strong> (I think we may have used it once or twice while I was visiting.)</li>
<h2 class="sub">Consumption</h2>
<li>You eat with your hands.</li>
<li>You eat more than three times a day.</li>
<li>You think a meal is not a meal without rice.</li>
<li>You eat rice for breakfast. (Sometimes.)</li>
<li>You use your fingers to measure the water you need to cook rice. (What <em>else</em> would you use?)</li>
<li>You eat your meal using a spoon and fork. (Of course!)</li>
<li>You cut your meat with a spoon or fork. (Yeah, what else do you use? A knife?)</li>
<li>You feed all your visitors. (How could you not?)</li>
<li>If you don't live at home, when your parents call, they ask if you've eaten, even if it's midnight.</li>
<li>You always cook too much.</li>
<li><strong>You bring baon to work everyday. </strong>(Ok, sometimes I'd buy a sandwich across the street.)</li>
<li><strong>You keep your stove covered in aluminum foil when not in use.</strong> (Nope.)</li>
<li><strong>You don't own any real tupperware-- only a cupboard full of used but carefully rinsed margarine tubs, takeout containers, and jam jars.</strong> (I think I own one tupperware. And then a bunch of re-used tubs, containers, and jars.)</li>
<li>You wash and re-use plastic utensils, styrofoam cups, and aluminum wrappers. (Of course!)</li>
<li><strong>Your pantry is never without Spam, Vienna sausage, corned beef, and sardines.</strong> (No, but it's true for my parents' house.)</li>
<li>You love to eat daing or tuyo. (daing na bangus!)</li>
<li><strong>You prop up one knee while eating.</strong></li>
<li>You eat your meal with patis, toyo, suka, banana catsup, or bagoong. (Or all of the above. Mm, Jufran!)</li>
<li><strong>Your tablecloths are stained with toyo circles.</strong> (What tablecloth?)</li>
<li>You love sticky desserts and salty snacks.</li>
<li><strong>You eat fried Spam and hot dogs with rice.</strong> (What else would you eat them with?)</li>

<li><strong>You grab a toothpick after every meal.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You wave a pom-pom on a stick around the food to keep the flies away.</strong> (I live in New England. The winters are 6 months long. Bugs <em>die</em> here.)</li>
<li>When dining out, you always fight over who will pay for dinner.</li>
<li>When you're in a restaurant, you wipe your plate and utensils before using them. (Sometimes.)</li>
<li>You put hot dogs in your spaghetti. (Yeah!)</li>
<li>Everything you eat is sauted in garlic, onion, and tomatoes. (Not always the tomatoes, but yes.)</li>
<li>You eat every last grain of rice in your bowl, but don't eat the last piece of food on the table. (Wait, other people don't?)</li>
<li>You find dried morsels of rice stuck to your shirt. (Occasionally.)</li>
<h2 class="sub">Religion</h2>
<li>You hang a rosary on your car's rear view mirror. (My dad asked me to.)</li>
<li><strong>You play cards or mahjong and drink beer at funeral wakes.</strong> (I don't know how to do most of this, and I've only been to one wake.)</li>
<li>You think Christmas season begins in October and ends in January.  (Oh, yes.)</li>
<li>You unwrap Christmas gifts very carefully, so you can save and reuse the wrapping (and especially those bows) next year.</li>
<li><strong>You make the sign of the cross before take-offs and after landings and every time you pass by a church.</strong> (I know people who do.)</li>
<h2 class="sub">Travel</h2>
<li><strong>Your second piece of luggage is a balikbayan box.</strong> (Second piece? Luggage? I travel with a backpack.)</li>
<li>You've mastered the art of packing a suitcase to double capacity. (With presents. Of toothpaste. That my parents ask me to bring to family.)</li>
<li>You are standing next to eight boxes at the airport. (Again, from family.)</li>
<li>You collect items from airlines, hotels, and restaurants as "souvenirs." (Free shampoo!)</li>
<li>You feel obligated to give pasalubong to all your friends and relatives each time you return from a trip. (See: #73, toothpaste.)</li>
<li><strong>You drive a Honda Civic or Integra.</strong> (I don't have a car.)</li>
<li><strong>You have those air fresheners that you buy at Filipino stores in your car. </strong>(See above.)</li>
<li><strong>You have a trendy perfume bottle and some stuffed animals in your car.</strong> (See above.)</li>
<li><strong>You carry a stash of your own food</strong> (usually dried) (See above.)</li>
<li><strong>You can squeeze 15 passengers into your five seater car without a second thought.</strong> (Oh <em>yeah</em>.)</li>
<h2 class="sub">Shopping</h2>
<li><strong>You can't make a purchase without haggling.</strong> (Oh, come on. I've done this.)</li>
<li>You're a fashion victim. (I don't care.)</li>
<li>The condiments in your fridge are either Costco sized or come in plastic packets, which you save/steal every time you get take out or go to McDonalds. (...oh, that's' not normal?)</li>
<li>Ditto paper napkins. (But they're free!)</li>
<li><strong>Your mom asks you to pick up the extra carton of eggs on sale (but limit 1 only) and pay for it at a separate check out counter.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You see corn beef on sale you buy a lot and send it to the Philippines.</strong> (This happens more with things like dietary fiber.)</li>
<li>You know someone who can get you a good deal on jewelry or electronics. (The latter.)</li>
<h2 class="sub">Non-verbal Communication</h2>

<li><strong>You cover your mouth when you laugh.</strong></li>
<h2 class="sub">Language</h2>
<li><strong>You respond to a "Hoy!" or a "Pssst!" in a crowd.</strong> (Can't hear consonants.)</li>
<li><strong>You'll answer "Malapit lang!"--no matter the distance--when asked how far away a place is located.</strong> (No, but I'll say the English equivalent - everything is very close nearby.)</li>
<li>Goldilocks is more than a fairy tale character to you. (ONE OF THE BEST BAKERIES EVER YAY NOM NOM NOM)</li>
<li>You refer to power interruptions as "brownouts."</li>
<li><strong>You love to use the following acronyms: CR for comfort room, DI for dance instructor, DOM for dirty old man, TNT for tago nang tago, KJ for kill joy, KSP for kulang sa pansin, OA for over-acting, TL for true love, BF for boyfriend and GF for girlfriend.</strong> (Only when I've been in Manila for a while.)</li>

<li>You let the phone ring twice before answering, lest you appear overly eager. (Yeah!)</li>
<li><strong>Your parents send money to their relatives in Philippines.</strong> (I don't think so - they're all doing pretty well. We bring pasalubong.)</li>
