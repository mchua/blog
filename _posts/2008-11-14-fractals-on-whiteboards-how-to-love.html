<p>My coworkers! Here's a <a href="http://blog.laptop.org/2008/11/14/now-thats-a-great-smile/">picture</a> of (almost) the entire OLPC office.</p>
<p>I'm missing from this picture because I was frantically running the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Community_testing_meetings/2008-11-13">community testing meeting</a> on IRC, about 30 feet to the right of everybody gathered at the whiteboard.<br />
(Blogging: A good quick-break stress-relief valve that keeps me in "churn out G1G1 text!" mode.)</p>
<p>Hey, Christina took a picture of the whiteboard! Yay for Christina!</p>

<p>When I go to parties, I occasionally end up <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/seth/2008/11/03/seirpinski-love/">drawing fractals</a> on whiteboards with random guys.</p>
<p>Now I have 15 minutes to clean my house and do a lot of laundry. Up up and awayyyyyyy!</p>
