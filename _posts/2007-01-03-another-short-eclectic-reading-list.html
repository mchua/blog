<p>I swear I must have posted this before: most folks fritter their time away and don't understand how much more they could and should want to cram into their 24 hours.</p>
<p>Another read that made my mind spin: he's a radical (or at least presents himself as such). I definitely don't agree with everything he says, and I don't think the extremist viewpoint he proposes and the fiery voice he speaks in is the best way of getting things done. I do greatly admire his eloquence and courage in saying such things, though; this is one man I would love to meet.</p>
<p>Gui recommended <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry/dp/0060589469">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</a> by Pirsig. It's good; I read it on the bus to the Media Lab when I was working there two summers ago. This is one of those books that slowly crackles away in the back of your mind as you read it; you don't notice until you look up, something goes <span style="font-style: italic;">snap!</span> and you shake your head and wonder what's rattled loose to make you see things so differently.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Down-Bones-Shambhala-Classics/dp/1590303164">Writing Down The Bones</a> is a book I've bought and given away multiple times. Short, poetic reflections on writing itself that will transform the way you write; it's one of the things on my inspirational writing rotation (Shakespeare is another common appearance) that I read through  whenever I start feeling that my prose is growing dead and mechanical.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alcyone.com/max/lit/flatland/">Flatland: A romance of many dimensions</a> is not sappy in the least; it's mathematical (and therefore I love it). It's a story told by the denizen of a two-dimensional world (A. Square) who is trying to grasp three-dimensional space. I discovered this book in high school simultaneously with linear algebra, non-Newtonian physics, and non-Euclidian geometry, and it was pure delight. Speaking of non-Newtonian physics, anything by Alan Lightman (especially <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Einsteins-Dreams-Alan-Lightman/dp/140007780X">Einstein's Dreams</a>) is just beautiful. Reading Lightman's essays gives me the same quiet feeling I have when I stare out a window and see thick white snowflakes swirling softly in the lamplight. He expresses the loveliness of mathematics and science in a way I would like to... not imitate, but admire and honor by finding my own way of writing about such things.*</p>
<p>Sequels to Flatland (Flatterland, Sphereland, the Planiverse...) have been written. All the ones I've read are good; I read them over a spread-out enough time-scale that I'm not 100% confident in my rating of which are best. Someday I'll collect them all and do a storybook reading in order - I wish someone would publish a single volume collecting them all, as they've done for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lord-Rings-Collectors-J-R-R-Tolkien/dp/0395193958">Lord of the Rings</a>, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chronicles-Narnia-C-S-Lewis/dp/0060598247/">Chronicles of Narnia</a>, or even the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Feynman-Lectures-Physics-Definitive-Extended/dp/0805390456">Feynman Lectures on Physics.</a></p>
<p>*Lightman teaches at MIT's <a href="http://web.mit.edu/sciwrite/">Graduate Program in Science Writing</a>. I wish I could just stay a student forever - there are so many teachers I want to learn from, classes I want to go to, schools I would attend...</p>
