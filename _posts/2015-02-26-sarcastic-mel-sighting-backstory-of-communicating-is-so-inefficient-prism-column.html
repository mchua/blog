<p>Apparently, I have a snarky side. This post is the backstory for how my recent ASEE Prism column, <a href="http://www.asee-prism.org/unstable-equilibrium-jan-2/">"Communicating Is So Inefficient,"</a> came to be.</p>
<p>TL;DR summary: the article's first sentence is "After years of observing engineering education, I’ve finally figured out what our goal is: minimal student-teacher interaction." The rest of the article points out the observations that led to this conclusion, in the vein of <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2594">this SMBC comic</a> of aliens speculating about the human war against plant genitalia (translation: we give flowers as gifts).</p>
<p>The article started after several colleagues approached me, in separate conversations, and started venting like this: "Aargh! I am trying to do this thing that requires students to start an open-ended dialogue with me about their work in the discipline, and..."</p>
<p>At this point, they would say some combination of these three things:</p>
<blockquote><p>A) The students don't get it, don't do it, and are complaining that I'm "not teaching them"!<br />
B) Senior colleagues/admins tell me I'm not supposed to do that if I want to survive tenure!<br />
C) It is impossible to have these conversations with all the students I've been given, in the time I've been allotted, while still covering the content I'm required to cover!</p></blockquote>
<p>Basically, I was hearing my colleagues genuinely thirsting to interact with students -- engage with their individual processes, help shepherd what they were creating, get to know them -- and running into an education system that penalized them for doing so. At some point, I started giving this response to point (A):</p>
<blockquote><p>"Of course they don't want to talk to you. These were the 'smart kids' in high school. They've been conditioned to associate 'asking a question' with 'not knowing stuff.' If you talk to a teacher, that means you're failing and something is wrong."</p></blockquote>
<p>And then I realized that it wasn't just the students who'd been conditioned this way. My colleagues were the teachers who were actively resisting the same system trying to condition them <em>away </em>from talking with their students. I started getting sarcastic in those conversations. "Oh, no, you can't do <em>that. </em>We need to process <em>more </em>students through the system. No, no, we just need to automate <em>everything. </em>Not just the grading. The teaching and the learning, too."</p>
<p>When people laughed at an observation I'd made, I wrote it down. And then I started putting them together into paragraphs, and then my editor emailed and said "we need your column" and I hadn't written anything else...</p>
<p>And that's how the rare sighting of Sarcastic Mel came to be.</p>
