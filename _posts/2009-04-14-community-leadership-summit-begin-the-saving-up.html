<p><a href="http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/attendees/">I. Am. GOING.</a> I have no idea how, or how I will afford this (my savings, they run low... yea, I doth needeth income streams sometime in the next 6 months) but... actually, this is a great catch: I can't pay for my planefare with my savings. I have to find a way to earn my way there.</p>
<p>I still can't get over the fact that people do this for a living. Oh man oh man oh man oh man.</p>
<p>I'd also love to go to <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/">oscon</a>, but it's really, really, really expensive and maybe I should... regain the ability to type first so I can get back to doing community work.</p>
<p>Well. Wait, hang on. Idiot. Stop falling back to thinking of yourself as a small child pretending to play grown-up and start thinking of yourself as a young professional - a self-taught journeyman still looking for someone to prentice under*, <i>and</i> someone who has done and can do pretty awesome things already. </p>
<p>*I know that's backwards. I'm at the point where I don't need school for this... I need to watch the masters so that I'll gradually get a sense of what questions to ask of them and myself. I need more exposure, more data from this world.**</p>
<p>**I need to go and take care of my body now so I have the physical capacity to participate in it. Hello, painful hands. I'll stop now.</p>
