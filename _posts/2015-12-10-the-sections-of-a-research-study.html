<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Todd, Lindsey, and I are in the middle of debating what the sections of a research study writeup are supposed to do. My version:</span></p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> "You know this giant hulking beast that we all acknowledge is a Very Important Problem Or Question In Our Field? Well, I'm solving it. Er. A very small chunk of it. Smaller. Um... smaller... and.... and... narrowing down on my incredibly tiny... little... specific... contribution... AHA! Yes. Yes, this is my research question."</p>
<p><strong>Lit review:</strong> "It's dangerous to go alone! Take this!" In other words, what do you need to know as background before you can understand the work I did? I think of this section as putting tools into the reader's backpack... or, if I want a cooler mental image, the "I know Kung Fu" moment from the Matrix.</p>

<p><strong>Methods:</strong> "Let me tell you what I did."</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> I MADE A THING!</p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> So what?</p>
<p>I would also like to state, for the record, that I am fighting the temptation to open a subsection of my lit review with BuzzFeed-style headers.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Here are 5 great tools for understanding complex human narratives. #3 will blow your mind."</li>
<li>"She thought she had successfully catalogued all possible perspectives on the topic from a neutral point of view. You won't believe what happens next."</li>
</ul>
