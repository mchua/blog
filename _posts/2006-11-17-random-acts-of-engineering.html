<p>I'm home in IL for the holidays, wandering bored through a shopping mall because my mother's returning things, when I get a phone call.</p>
<p>"Hey! So, ah, Eric found this design competition..."<br />"Where <span style="font-style: italic;">are </span>you?"<br />"We're in the library. I know you're in Illinois, but - are you by a computer?"<br />"I'm almost afraid to ask, but when's the deadline?"<br />"Ah.... midnight?" (It's 6:30pm.)</p>
<p>There goes my evening. The next 5.5 hours were spent happily chatting away on phones and laptops while simultaneously brainstorming, developing, and presenting 4 different product concepts for the (month-long, apparently) competition. Papers flew. Pixels flew. I completely bewildered my mother by asking her to pose next to an electrical outlet. And the final products were... not too bad, in my biased opinion - downright decent if you consider they were done with no planning on a randomly assembled distributed team in the span of a night, minus dinnertimes.</p>
<p>Random acts of engineering. That, plus the excellent potato-leek soup we had for lunch, just completely made my day.</p>
<p>Speaking of distributed teams, I just want to say I LOVE MY TEAM*. Phil and Hiroo from Scotland are gorgeous designers and absolutely wonderful to work with for our distributed engineering design course project, and Chandra was infinitely patient with <span style="font-style: italic;">everything</span> and totally kickass at making our prototypes both structurally sound and manufacturable. Hopefully I made up for my ineptness over videoconferences (can't... read... lips...) by introducing shiny software; since it was a more mechanical-ish design challenge (coffee cup holders) I thought my computer skillz would go unused, but awareness of online collaboration tools was definitely helpful.</p>
<p>*originally intended to refer to the distributed team, but thinking about it right now I can honestly say I love every single team, group, and committee I'm on this semester - not just "like," "tolerate," or "uh... it's a valuable learning experience," I really <span style="font-style: italic;">love </span>the people on them and the spirit in them, which is incredibly unusual... and boy, it feels good. I want this feeling more. The world is such a happy place when you have awesome teammates to work with.</p>
<p>It's 2am Eastern, so I'm getting an early snooze in an attempt to make up for sleep debt. G'night, folks.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></p>
