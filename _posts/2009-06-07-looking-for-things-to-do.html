<p>I've had to trim down my <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/User:Mchua#Current_goals_and_projects">projects for this release</a> due to RSI, but there are still many things I'd like to see happen this release cycle, and I'd love to mentor interested people through them. (Newcomers, this especially means you. If you've been looking for a way to get involved but don't know how, <i>this is how.</i>)</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/User:Mchua#Future_goals_and_projects">Here's the list.</a></p>
<p>In broad sweeping strokes, they fall into 3 categories (the first one includes tasks for each team, so if you're interested in marketing/development/Activities/wiki-ninjahood/etc. but don't know where to start, start there).<br /><a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/User:Mchua#Future_goals_and_projects"><span class="toctext"></span></a>
<ul>
<li class="toclevel-2"><a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/User:Mchua#Entry_points_for_all_SL_teams"><span class="tocnumber"></span><span class="toctext">Entry points for all SL teams</span></a></li>
<li class="toclevel-2"><a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/User:Mchua#Well-defined_open_tasks"><span class="tocnumber"></span><span class="toctext">Well-defined open tasks</span></a></li>
<li class="toclevel-2"><a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/User:Mchua#Local_Labs_formation_and_communication_should_be_easy"><span class="tocnumber"></span><span class="toctext">Local Labs formation and communication should be easy</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested in any of these things, shoot me an email (mel at sugarlabs dot org) and we'll get going.</p>
