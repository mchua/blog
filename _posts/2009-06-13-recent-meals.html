<p>Some of you know that I'm a bit of a food geek. Here are some of the meals I've enjoyed lately.</p>
<p>A vegetarian housemate brought back lobster from a department dinner, and I scored a couple steaming, spicy claws. Man, it's been a while since I ate food like that.</p>
<p>Cinnamon raisin bagel spread with mascarpone cheese mixed with fig-cocoa jam. (Ficoco is one of the best ideas I've ever run across. I might even tie it with apple butter and Nutella.) Thin banana slices on top. Prior to obtaining said magical jam, I was going with raspberry preserves, peanut butter, and cream cheese on a toasted bagel with thin banana slices, which was plenty good as well.</p>
<p>Locally-grown organic tomatoes that had actually been ripened on the vine, cut into thick slices (some of which were eaten raw because those things were just <i>too</i> juicy and delicious to let pass). Big handful of fresh basil leaves from a local farm pureed into olive oil. Local artisan mozzarella cheese. Layer and let the flavors seep into each other for several hours. <i>Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh</i>. I consumed 3 tomatoes and a fist-sized cheese along with enough basil to make it difficult to hold the leaves in two hands as I carried it out to the blender. This is a LOT of food. It was <i>good</i>. My first true summer meal of 2009.</p>
<p>Some of that basil-cheese-tomato gorgeousness was served between toasted English muffin, some of it was perched atop a spicy burger flecked with peppercorns and pecorino and fried in butter on a cast-iron skillet. When all the tomatoes and cheese were gone, there was still a rich green juice, fragrant from the basil, sweet and tart from the tomatoes, with a faint cheesy tang... I poured it into a barley stew and the resultant subtle layering of those flavors over the curried vegetables in the stew had me pausing to grin between spoonfuls.</p>
<p>Speaking of cast-iron skillets, frying two eggs in garlicky olive oil and then bubbling them on top of a spicy spinach-lentil dal makes for a lovely breakfast mash, particularly when pre-gamed with a massive bowl of honey cereal flakes topped with yogurt and apple butter (because you're too impatient to wait for everything to finish cooking before you eat).</p>
<p>At some point soon, I should bake bread again.</p>
