<ol>
<li>Boston is cold (significantly so for an appreciable portion of the year)</li>
<li>Mel is highly susceptible to cold (I have the masochism-fu to consciously endure it with no problem, but when I'm trying to concentrate on something else - for instance, work or sleep - it doesn't work.)</li>
<li>Mel loves living in Boston</li>
</ol>
<p>Uh... yeah. Houston, we have a problem. Namely: I should live in your climate. But New England is just... awesome, and I don't want to leave.</p>
<p>Currently wearing double socks, double pants, double shirts, a sweater, and a big down jacket, and it's <i>October </i>for crying out loud<i>.</i> I need... more winter clothes...</p>
