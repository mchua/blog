<p>The countdown to submitting Sugar Labs's application to be a 2009 Google Summer of Code (GSoC) organization has begun. (That was a long and overly complex sentence, but we shall press onwards!)</p>
<p>If you have a moment, please take a look, leave comments, and make any last-minute edits you might have to <a href="http://sugarlabs.org/go/Summer_of_Code/SL_application">our current application</a>, which is in response to the <a href="http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2009/faqs.html#0_1_org_app_08250740394219425_">questions posted here</a>. Many thanks to <a href="http://sugarlabs.org/go/User:Walter">Walter Bender</a> and <a href="http://sugarlabs.org/go/User:Homunq">Jameson Quinn</a> for doing a great job on our org app (with a special thanks to Jameson for continuously sending reminders and scheduling meetings to keep us on top of things)! </p>
<p>We particularly need some work done on our <a href="http://sugarlabs.org/go/Summer_of_Code/SL_application#What_is_the_URL_for_your_ideas_page.3F">ideas page</a>, which will be the focus of the next 12 or so hours of my life (...after a few hours of sleep, that is).</p>
<p>This is the first summer we've been present as an organization to participate in GSoC, so we're lucky to have a number of experienced Sugar coders signed up as mentors and shadow-mentors, many of whom are <a href="http://sugarlabs.org/go/Summer_of_Code/SL_application#Who_will_your_mentors_be.3F_Please_include_Google_Account_information.">veteran GSoC mentors or students</a>. We've also gotten some invaluable coaching from former GSoC administrators at other open-source projects and former GSoC students who worked on Sugar when it was part of OLPC, leading to things like our requirement that applicants <a href="http://sugarlabs.org/go/Summer_of_Code/SL_application#Miscellaneous">demonstrate that they have a working development environment</a> and the practice of holding mandatory IRC check-in meetings once a week throughout the project.</p>
<p>My favorite part of our application, though, has got to be this:</p>
<blockquote><p>We will launch a Sugar pilot near each accepted project so that students can see immediate results and feedback from children and teachers using their work, thus investing them further in longer-term sustainability and getting their local communities involved as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>Awesome software is a tool. Communities where children are learning about learning is the goal. Showing students how their work on the first directly impacts and benefits the second is, I think, one of the most important outcomes we can have.</p>
