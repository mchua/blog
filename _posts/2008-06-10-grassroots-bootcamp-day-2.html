<div style="">The grassroots bootcamp continued today with:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Alabama deployment) on training volunteers, getting funding, and building local communities. This led into side discussions on grassroots finances and more...</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.printf.net/">Chris Ball</a> gave us all a crash course on <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Pippy">Pippy</a>, a learn-by-example programming Activity, and how it can be used to develop Activities and scripts for the XO. Again, the topic was so compelling that a cluster could be found huddled in the back corner talking about internationalization of Pippy, even after plates of food had been placed less than 10 feet away.</li>
<li>Special guests included Pam Cooney from <a href="http://worldcomputerexchange.org/">World Computer Exchange</a> and <a href="http://logothings.wikispaces.com/">Cynthia Solomon</a> from the OLPC Learning Team, one of the co-creators of Logo. </li>

</ul>
<p>All this and more (including - yes, you guessed it, transcripts!) are available <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_bootcamp/Results#Tuesday">here</a>.</p>
<p>*we were strange 8-year-olds, yes.</div>
