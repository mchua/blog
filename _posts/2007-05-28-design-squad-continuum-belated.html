<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Last summer during brainstorm training at <a href="http://dcontinuum.com">Continuum </a>we did our final round on ways to build a hill for the upcoming <a href="http://pbskids.org/designsquad">Design Squad</a> show (a game show for teenage engineers). Since the episode hadn't started filming yet (alas, they shot about a week after I left) we weren't supposed to talk about it at the time in case one of the contestants would hear. Now that it's out, I can say that they designed "summer sleds" that roll down grassy hills - the end products resemble either toboggans-on-wheels or <i>very</i> low-riding wagons.</p>
<p>I finally watched the <a href="http://pbskids.org/designsquad/episodes/">episode </a>tonight (episode 13, "Winner Takes All") and the grass hill in the office - they built one inside by the main staircase - looks even better than I'd thought. Continuum is really as cool as it looks, especially after the office renovation - although there isn't incessant screaming, cheering, and camera zooming a-la MTV as per the episode. It's also <i>really weird</i> to see your former coworkers on television. I'm biased, but seeing Continuum people up there was the best part of the whole show for me.</p>
<p>Ok, so I could have done without the incessant pop licks and Really! Upbeat! Cheerfulness! but shows like Design Squad are a step in the right direction towards making engineering cool - and just as important, <i>more transparent</i> - to students. I'm looking forward to seeing where they go. My own documentary* on engineering teams is going to take a less scripted, more reflective approach - it'll be interesting to see how the two compare.</p>
<p>*Yeah, I really need to figure out how to get digital film equipment. I knew microphones were expensive, but sheesh! Any recs for getting budget cameras/lights/microphones/lens/software/etc? I'll need it pretty long-term, a bit over a month (July to mid-August).</div>
