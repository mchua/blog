<p>Jeff Elkner: <a href="http://proyectojuanchacon.blogspot.com/2009/07/where-to-all-geek-girls-go.html?showComment=1248412958702#c7020225031721697484">where do all the geek girls go?</a> A high school teacher grapples with the realization that there's actually an age at which the "tech is boy stuff!" inflection point hits - somewhere in middle school, girls drop out of <a href="http://proyectojuanchacon.blogspot.com/2009/07/where-to-all-geek-girls-go.html?showComment=1248412958702#c7020225031721697484">STEM</a>. (My response was basically "sometimes they just don't think of themselves as geeks, for various reasons, even if they do or previously did what adults could see as "geeky stuff.") </p>
<p>Caroline brought up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development#Development">Zone of Proximal Development</a>, the space between what I can do by myself and what I can do with someone else's help. It's where you want to learn; it's where teaching and mentorship are most useful (because really, how can you teach someone something they can't even do with help - although perhaps zen koans might not fit this framework...)</p>
<p>Every time I learn about things from "the world of education," they make a lot of sense. They stretch my brain, they're subtle, good, tough to <i>really</i> understand, but they make sense the same way some math or the "feel" of a brainstorm just Makes Sense to me. I mostly just don't have the big names names and vocabulary words down, so I don't know the right search terms to find the good research on these kinds of things.</p>
<p>I need to find a mailing list or IRC channel or Planet of education researchers to listen to - or whatever the equivalent would be in that domain (scholarly papers, yes, but researchers don't have casual conversations in those formats...) - any ideas where to look, or what the list/channel/Planet equivalents would be? And yes, I'm applying for education grad school in the fall - nothing like immersion to teach you a language and a culture.</p>
