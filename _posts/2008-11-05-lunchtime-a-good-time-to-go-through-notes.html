<p>Ah, geekhood. There is <em>no</em> better way to spend a lunch break than with cheddar scrambled eggs, apple-plum smoothies, Ben Folds playing, and chuckling ironically over recognizing <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">big balls of mud</a> in your life. (To anybody who ever sees my old robotics code again: I'm very, very sorry. I actually put in docstrings now, I swear.)*</p>
<p>*Although that code was better than the infamous schoolbus algorithm simulator I wrote in high school for a math modeling competition. I had not yet learned about objects. It was 17 double-sided tiny-font printout pages of one <em>giant</em> while loop that tunneled through multiply-nested arrays declared in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation">Hungarian notation</a>. After we placed in the competition, I deleted the files in disgust and decided to learn about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a>. (The sad thing was that I was the team's sole coder because they needed one for the girl's group - there were no mixed-gender teams - and there was literally <em>nobody else</em>.)</p>
<p>Found a veritable <a href="http://cag.csail.mit.edu/ict4dev/">bonanza of reading materials</a> about Information and Communication technologies for development (as in "the developing world," though I... have my reservations about that term).</p>
<p>Also, you can use <a href="http://ifacethoughts.net/2008/05/02/vim-as-a-personal-wiki/">vim as a wiki</a>. (Translation: Do you also like keeping your notes in plaintext files? Now you can link them together without making them non-plaintext files.)</p>
<p>Just ran across my notes from when Henry taught me about the <a href="http://trinityhome.org/Home/blog.php?front_id=15">trinity rescue kit</a>, which you can use to recover severely borked systems. Of course, I had to ask how one would prevent malicious use of the TRK to grab data from a hard drive without authorization, so then he showed me <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">truecrypt</a>. The tradeoff: if your encrypted data's borked, it's <em>borked</em>. It's kind of scary how much of "security" is just a thin shiny layer that makes us feel good. (Also helping with this mental shift: my further adventures in learning lock-picking.)</p>
<p>I'm drowning in emails. I think I will section off some time to attack that after a meeting this afternoon.</p>
