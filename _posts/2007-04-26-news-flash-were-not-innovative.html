<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After anthropology class today I was doing research and read this note from the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/ssilbey/www/diverse_leadership.html">Futurepaths </a>study.</p>
<blockquote><p>Research from the neo-institutional perspective suggests that despite the effort to innovate, Smith and Olin are likely to develop programs that are isomorphic with the existing institutions. Despite efforts to hire and retain “non-traditional”professionals,   the faculty at Smith and Olin, socialized and educated in the dominant, institutional culture of engineering, are likely to mimic and replicate the values, pedagogies, professional orientations, and taken-for-granted assumptions of conventional engineering through their teaching.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's... true. At least I think it's true. Everything I've heard, seen, read, and done at Olin, coupled with everything I've read about the history of education and higher education, about pedagogy and classroom techniques, about educational philosophies and engineering philosophies and social theories and descriptions of engineering subcultures... all that has led me to the same conclusion no matter how hard I try to escape it. Finally reading someone else's words saying the same thing I'd been thinking for months - and subtly, years - was like a blow to the gut.</p>
<p>Now, this doesn't mean that being isomorphic is <i>bad</i>, even if it's true (and I'm starting to believe that it is, although I can't yet articulate it with a solid body of non-hearsay, non-biased evidence... that's what research projects are for). It's an opportunity. A tremendous chance to reexamine the foundations of our beliefs and assumptions. What have we taken for granted? What is engineering, and what does it mean to teach engineers? Become more aware of what we're doing, what we're not doing, why... and then, if we feel it is needed, we can change it. If we don't change it, we will <i>still</i> know what we are doing and what effect it has, and that's fantastic as well.</p>
<p>The trouble, in my opinion, is when a school does "magic," which I'll define as having something that functionally works while simultaneously baffling everyone as to why it does. Inertia starts because of "magic." You don't want to spoil this thing that's working; touch it and who knows what will happen and whether you can put it back together again? (Think of the hesitancy some non-techies display when faced with the controls of a complex machine, no matter how robust the device actually is.) If you get to the root of the "magic" and understand the system and the tradeoffs you're making, you gain the power and confidence to change it, and the power and confidence to keep it the same <i>out of conscious knowledge, not fear</i>.</p>
<p>That's an important point I don't think is brought up often enough nowadays in the Age of Innovation-As-Buzzword. "Innovation" doesn't necessarily mean WHOA NEW SHINY THING LOOK AT ME ME ME! Sometimes it means understanding old things in different ways. Quiet, subtle musings are just as important as outrageously bold actions.</p>
<blockquote><p>After the earthquake there was fire--but the LORD was not in the fire. After the fire there was a tiny whispering sound. When he heard this, Elijah hid his face in his cloak and went and stood at the entrance of the cave. A voice said to him, "Elijah, why are you here?"</p>
