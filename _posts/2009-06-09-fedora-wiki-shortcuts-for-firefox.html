<p>I've found myself using the Fedora wiki often enough these days that it's time to make a set of Firefox keyword shortcuts for it.</p>
<p>Here they are: <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Mchua/Templates">Fedora wiki shortcuts</a> - no need to type the full URL into your address bar again! Once you get them, you'll be able to do things like this:</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>f = Fedora Wiki</b> - for instance, <i>f Ambassadors</i> will take you to <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors" title="Ambassadors">Ambassadors</a> </li>
<li> <b>fs = Fedora Wiki search</b> - for instance,   <i>fs Foo</i> will take you to <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Special:Search%3Fsearch%3DFoo" class="new" title="Special:Search?search=Foo (page does not exist)">Special:Search?search=Foo</a> </li>
<li> <b>fg = Fedora Wiki google search</b> - for instance, <i>fg Documentation</i> will take you to <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?q=Documentation&amp;hl=en&amp;domains=fedoraproject.org/wiki&amp;sitesearch=fedoraproject.org/wiki%7Ca" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/custom?q=Documentation&amp;hl=en&amp;domains=fedoraproject.org/wiki&amp;sitesearch=fedoraproject.org/wiki|a">google search on this wiki for "Documentation"</a> (I've found that google &gt;&gt; Mediawiki search, in general.)</li>
<li> <b>fu = Fedora Wiki userpage</b> - for instance, <i>fu Mchua</i> will take you to <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Mchua" title="User:Mchua">User:Mchua</a> </li>
<li> <b>ft = Fedora Wiki talkpage</b> - for instance, <i>ft Marketing</i> will take you to <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Marketing&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Talk:Marketing (page does not exist)">Talk:Marketing</a> </li>
<li> <b>fut = Fedora Wiki user talkpage</b> - for instance, <i>fut Mchua</i> will take you to <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User_talk:Mchua" title="User talk:Mchua">User_talk:Mchua</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>I've done this for the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Mchua/Templates#Browser_shortcuts">OLPC</a> and <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/User:Mchua/Firefox_shortcuts">Sugar Labs</a> wikis, and they've made my life a whole lot easier. If you take a look at those, you'll notice that the set's expanded to ticket trackers and mailing lists as well - as I move into that stuff, I'll update this list, and when I think it's reached a reasonably complete state, I'll package it up. 'Course, people are welcome to beat me to this at any time. ;-)</p>
