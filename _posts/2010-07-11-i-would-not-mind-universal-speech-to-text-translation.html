<p>Tiny vent time right now.
<ul>
<li>I can't hear.</li>
<li>This includes phone calls. I mostly have a phone so I can send and receive text messages[0].</li>
<li>My voicemail message says,   explicitly, <i>I can't hear, do not leave me voicemail, it will not, not, NOT get listened to because I CAN'T HEAR.</i></li>
<li>When I give people my phone number (when I must), I always write something to the effect of "I can't hear, please SMS or email."</li>
<li>PEOPLE STILL LEAVE VOICEMAIL.[1][2]</li>
</ul>
<p>[0] There are exceptions. When people I know very well - folks who I've talked with often and long enough to be used to their voice and word choice patterns - call and talk with me on a subject I know (and which thus has predictable conversations paths), I can make it through a call. <i>It's still hard</i>. Generally speaking, the cognitive load needed for me to process audio-only data is sufficient to make my reasoning sub-par when I can't lipread (or in other words, if you want me to be able to think and comment intelligently on what you're saying, <i>find a way to let me read your lips</i>). Drive out to meet me. Turn around to face me. Grab a webcam. Go to text chat. Something. Anything. Seriously.</p>
<p>[1] And expect me to call them back and speak with their customer service representatives. I need to find a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_Service">relay service</a> I'm happy with because AT&amp;T over AIM has not been able to help me make my calls the last 5 or so times I've tried. Not sure what's up with that.</p>
<p>[2] Imagine needing to ask a friend to listen to - and relay - <i>every</i> voicemail message you ever get. Think about how inconvenient, potentially embarrassing, and - honestly - downright disempowering - that would feel. I realize I have a lot of privilege, I realize this is a minor thing compared to what many other people have to go through, but... after a decade (I've had a phone for 10 years now) it's starting to get to me a little.</p>
<p>I've vented about this before, but still don't have a good solution. Any ideas?</p>
