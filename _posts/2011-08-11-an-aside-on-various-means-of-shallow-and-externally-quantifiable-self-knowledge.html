<p>I'm a sucker for chasing down fascinating threads mentioned in books, strongest at top):</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Love of learning</b>: You love learning new things, whether in a<br />
class or on your own. You have always loved school, reading, and<br />
museums-anywhere and everywhere there is an opportunity to learn.</li>
<li><b>Creativity, ingenuity, and originality:</b> Thinking of new<br />
ways to do things is a crucial part of who you are. You are never<br />
content with doing something the conventional way if a better way is<br />
possible.</li>
<li><b>Curiosity and interest in the world:</b> You are curious about<br />
everything. You are always asking questions, and you find all subjects<br />
and topics fascinating. You like exploration and discovery.</li>
<li><b>Zest, enthusiasm, and energy: </b>Regardless of what you do,<br />
you approach it with excitement and energy. You never do anything<br />
halfway or halfheartedly. For you, life is an adventure.</li>
<li><b>Appreciation of beauty and excellence:</b> You notice and<br />
appreciate beauty, excellence, and/or skilled performance in all domains<br />
of life, from nature to art to mathematics to science to everyday<br />
experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not a bad picture, actually. My boyfriend will occasionally do an imitation of the energetic version of me, which goes something like: "Hi! I'm a Mel! I'm excited! It's a crazy, crazy world. Teach me teach me teach me?" That seems to mostly capture the first four; the fifth is harder to observe, but it's much of what goes through my mind in quieter moments when I'm held rapt by music or art or an elegant mental turn of phrase, or just speculate about the grand complexity of the universe.</p>
<p>Topic shift to data correlation. When I write, I'm either confused/frustrated <i>and</i> actively moving at high velocity to figure out how to improve the situation, or happier in general than when I'm not writing (or rather, "my blog activity seems to correlate with an upwardly trending mood.") I don't know whether that's because I write when<br />
I'm happy, or because writing makes me happy. How could I test this? By<br />
forcing myself to write when I'm sad and depressed, or otherwise tending towards lethargy, and seeing if that has any noticeable effect.</p>
<p>Also, I'm considering getting a <a href="http://fitbit.com">fitbit</a>. <a href="http://www.openyou.org">OpenYou</a> has been doing some fascinating stuff with <a href="http://www.openyou.org/2011/05/26/libfitbit-development-update/">libfitbit</a> lately, but I should probably explore the use of my phone for these sorts of things before spending more money on another gadget. Personal datatracking is awfully useful, though.</p>
