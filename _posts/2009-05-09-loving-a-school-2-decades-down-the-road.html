<p>My Ninong (godfather) Sebastian <em>loves</em> his school. Over 20 years after graduating from DePaul,   his passion for it is unflagging. He'll talk about the difference it's making - how they've helped a lot of first-generation college students launch careers,   founded overseas entrepreneurship tracks to give bright, hard-working students overseas get a first-rate American MBA without having to leave their family halfway around the world without a breadwinner... Ninong's commitment to that school has led to a non-insignificant number of students enrolling there - and doing very, very well - directly because of him.</p>
<p>I want to care that much about the schools I go to. I want someone to say the same things about me 20 years from now, about how much I love Olin and IMSA. I want them to be places such that I <em>will</em> be that passionate about them still, decades down the road.</p>
<p>And since I care about them now, I'm going to work to make that happen.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
