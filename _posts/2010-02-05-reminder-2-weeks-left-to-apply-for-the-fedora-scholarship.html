<p>I did an <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2009/12/22/going-to-college-next-year-time-to-apply-for-the-fedora-scholarship/">earlier blog post</a> with more details, or you can just look at the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Scholarship">main Scholarship page</a> - but really, it's very simple.
<ol>
<li>Are you starting college next year?</li>
<li>Are you a Fedora contributor?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you've answered yes to both of those questions, <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Scholarship#How_to_apply">you should apply.</a></p>
<p>That is all.</p>
