<p>Concert #4 attended: yelling into a microphone and doing fan. We had to wait for two other bands (both of which confused me tremendously - one involved a surrealist b&amp;w projection and a theremin) before L&amp;L went on. </p>
<p>And they rocked. I want a CD so i can replay all those catchy licks all the time. (And I want to be able to play drums like Seamus.) As I type this, I have "Stacy By Gaslight" stuck in my head.</p>
<p>I'll skip the part where we got in trouble for going to the concert afterwards.</p>
<p>I will also add in dim-sum making lessons at Mrs. Lee's house, lumpia night, and good conversations with Greg. (Well, a good conversation, but one of a string of several.</p>
<p>And then I will sleep.</p>
