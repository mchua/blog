<p>w00t - the University of Kansas is MIT) of universities with open-by-default settings for their faculty's scholarly articles. It is the first public American university to do so.</p>
<p>This is definitely my knee-jerk young-'un "hurrah open access!" response, though - as someone who isn't (yet...) a publishing faculty member, journal editor, or school administrator, I'd love to hear the perspectives of those folks on initiatives like this. Maybe there's a cost or downside that I'm just not aware of. What keeps this kind of thing from being more widespread?</p>
